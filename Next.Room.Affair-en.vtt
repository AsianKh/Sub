00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.599
[laughing]

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.936
What's with you?
Not there, come on!

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:51.356
Come on, we always do that.

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:52.778
[muffled chatter]

00:03:52.913 --> 00:03:56.039
It's okay, I'll take care of you.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:59.072
Come on! Let's do it later!

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:04.460
- I know where you're ticklish.
- Not there!

00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:05.819
Ramon!

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:07.513
Come on!

00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:10.642
[muffled chatter]

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.950
I'm close!

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.601
It's so early,
why are you in a rush?

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:38.438
Babe!

00:06:39.023 --> 00:06:41.859
- You forgot your ID.
- I know right?

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.570
- Hey, you better behave.
- Babe!

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:45.737
Babe.

00:06:45.863 --> 00:06:46.948
Come home early, okay?

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.597
Taho...

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.655
- Hi!
- Oh, why are you late?

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.323
Got stuck in traffic.

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:31.951
But don't worry,
I'm here now.

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:32.994
Come in.

00:07:40.524 --> 00:07:42.124
[muffled chattering]

00:07:47.626 --> 00:07:49.754
Not there, it tickles!

00:07:50.394 --> 00:07:51.402
Stop it!

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:45.650
Shit...

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.950
Shit!

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:03.793
Shit!

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:30.695
- Does it feel good?
- So much!

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:49.088
Shit!

00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:50.881
Shit!

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.220
So good!

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.613
Oh shit!

00:09:57.741 --> 00:09:58.992
It feels so good!

00:09:59.044 --> 00:10:00.712
Really?

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:08.316
It feels so good!

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.858
That felt so good...

00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:31.889
It's hot, isn't it?

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.183
But it's cloudy.

00:15:35.392 --> 00:15:36.477
You're right.

00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:39.146
Are you the new tenant?

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.316
Yeah, I moved in just last week.

00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:45.736
It's quiet here every Sunday.

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:48.155
The tenants head home
to their provinces.

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:51.325
It's okay. I like it
better when it's quiet.

00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:54.870
Me too.

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:10.636
Alright, well, I'll go ahead.

00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:05.649
- Good evening.
- Good evening!

00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:10.398
- Good evening.
- Good evening!

00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:56.658
Excuse me!

00:17:57.493 --> 00:17:58.535
Excuse me!

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.412
Excuse me!

00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:01.455
Is there someone inside?

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:03.082
Excuse me!

00:18:03.832 --> 00:18:05.334
Oh! There's no one there.

00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:08.003
She left to go to Cavite.

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:10.881
Oh, I was hoping
to get my lights fixed.

00:18:10.964 --> 00:18:12.007
The bulb burned out.

00:18:12.674 --> 00:18:13.759
Where is it?
I'll check.

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:15.344
Okay, if you can do it.

00:18:15.552 --> 00:18:16.595
Thank you.

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:36.281
Do you have an extra bulb?

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.158
Yeah, wait, I have one.

00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:47.835
Here.

00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:16.530
There. It's okay now.

00:19:16.572 --> 00:19:17.823
Wow. Thank you.

00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:19.825
I thought I was going
to eat in total darkness.

00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:21.910
It's okay if you eat in the dark.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:23.871
It's exciting.

00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:26.748
I haven't tried it yet.

00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:27.958
Try it next time.

00:19:30.919 --> 00:19:31.962
I'll go now.

00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:33.338
Thank you.

00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:01.783
I'll probably do double duty tonight.

00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:04.161
Okay. Take care.

00:20:04.786 --> 00:20:06.163
Could you please
close the door for me?

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:07.956
Yeah, I'll handle it.

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:08.999
Okay.

00:20:42.157 --> 00:20:43.517
You're just on time,
she just left.

00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:45.702
You're so beautiful.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.422
Sit down.

00:20:58.382 --> 00:20:59.549
Thank you.

00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.094
How are you?

00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:04.972
I'm doing good. You?

00:21:05.013 --> 00:21:06.056
I'm fine too.

00:21:08.725 --> 00:21:10.477
I prepared something for you.

00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:12.229
- Wow.
- Because you're special.

00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:14.106
You're really prepared, huh?

00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:16.817
Of course, anything for you!

00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:25.492
I'll do it.

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:27.369
I'll do it myself.

00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:28.495
Okay.

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.259
You missed me, didn't you?

00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:36.855
- I missed this.
- Really?

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:37.856
Mhm!

00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:56.458
Shit. So good!

00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:17.414
See? I told you!

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.375
- You're right.
- Yeah!

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:23.462
- You're so sexy!
- Hey!

00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:27.340
So good.

00:24:38.101 --> 00:24:39.227
Thank you.

00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:41.104
Take care.

00:24:41.354 --> 00:24:42.397
You too.

00:24:42.856 --> 00:24:43.899
I enjoyed.

00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:38.216
Hi.

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:40.051
You're the new tenant?

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.886
Yes.

00:28:42.303 --> 00:28:44.806
- I'm Mara, by the way.
- Lea.

00:28:44.848 --> 00:28:45.974
You're quiet, aren't you?

00:28:46.449 --> 00:28:47.951
That's how I am.

00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:50.186
I don't have anyone to talk to.

00:28:56.693 --> 00:28:57.736
Is he your husband?

00:28:59.028 --> 00:29:00.029
Partner.

00:29:00.363 --> 00:29:02.258
We've been together for eight years,
not yet married.

00:29:02.282 --> 00:29:04.033
He doesn't want
to propose yet.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.786
He's not here?

00:29:06.953 --> 00:29:10.081
He has work. Sometimes he
isn't here during the evening.

00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:13.334
Have you been living here for long?

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.087
About two years.

00:29:17.797 --> 00:29:18.798
Okay.

00:29:18.965 --> 00:29:20.258
Nice to meet you.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.427
Nice to meet you, Lea.

00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:52.999
You're up early.

00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:55.794
I haven't slept yet.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:58.213
What's that?

00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.923
Insomnia?

00:30:01.716 --> 00:30:02.759
Do you need help?

00:30:05.512 --> 00:30:06.679
I'm fine.

00:30:15.104 --> 00:30:16.147
Thanks.

00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:18.149
You're welcome.

00:30:19.275 --> 00:30:20.318
What's your perfume?

00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:22.570
That's just my shampoo.

00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:25.865
It smells good.

00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:28.243
What's your name, by the way?

00:30:28.868 --> 00:30:29.911
Lea.

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:33.039
Okay. I'll go inside.

00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:16.708
Hello!

00:31:17.166 --> 00:31:18.668
Do you know how to fix a sink?

00:31:19.085 --> 00:31:20.670
Why? What's wrong?

00:31:20.962 --> 00:31:22.005
It's leaking.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:25.300
Let's go check it out.

00:31:25.341 --> 00:31:26.759
Come on.
Let's go inside.

00:31:31.431 --> 00:31:33.099
- Where is it?
- There.

00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:34.559
Oh, here it is.

00:31:44.277 --> 00:31:45.570
Seems like the valve is loose.

00:31:46.446 --> 00:31:47.447
Do you have a wrench?

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:48.781
I don't have one.

00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:53.077
Let me do this...

00:31:57.874 --> 00:31:59.375
The pressure's a bit weak.

00:32:00.668 --> 00:32:01.836
I'm going to borrow a wrench.

00:32:03.212 --> 00:32:04.380
Thank you so much.

00:32:09.886 --> 00:32:11.220
Are you always this quiet?

00:32:11.971 --> 00:32:13.431
I just don't know what to say.

00:32:38.081 --> 00:32:39.165
What? Why?

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:42.669
Nothing.

00:35:08.064 --> 00:35:09.065
So good!

00:35:51.586 --> 00:35:52.629
You can't sleep?

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.345
I can't.

00:35:55.633 --> 00:35:56.717
What about you?

00:35:58.531 --> 00:35:59.615
Trying to.

00:36:01.784 --> 00:36:02.827
Do you love her?

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.581
It's complicated.

00:36:08.347 --> 00:36:10.266
Are you just trying to
make me feel better?

00:36:11.625 --> 00:36:12.626
No.

00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:14.213
That's the truth.

00:36:15.464 --> 00:36:16.966
Then why are you here?

00:36:19.802 --> 00:36:20.845
I don't know.

00:36:24.432 --> 00:36:25.474
Okay.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:27.727
I don't really care anyways.

00:36:53.336 --> 00:36:54.378
No goodbye kiss?

00:36:59.175 --> 00:37:00.218
Take care.

00:40:08.447 --> 00:40:09.919
I'm close... I'm close!

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:48.779
Miss me?

00:40:49.238 --> 00:40:50.239
Yes.

00:41:24.648 --> 00:41:25.691
Just relax.

00:41:26.858 --> 00:41:28.569
Want to explore something?

00:41:31.169 --> 00:41:32.673
Just relax.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:20.454
I love you.

00:42:21.288 --> 00:42:22.289
Louder!

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.541
I love you.

00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:24.917
Okay, fine.

00:42:26.252 --> 00:42:28.712
Because of that,
here's your reward.

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:22.891
Harder!

00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:43.495
You feel so good...

00:43:58.135 --> 00:44:00.888
I'm close! I'm so close!

00:44:37.216 --> 00:44:38.634
I didn't see you last night.

00:44:40.552 --> 00:44:41.762
I was reviewing.

00:44:43.138 --> 00:44:44.181
Good girl.

00:44:44.598 --> 00:44:45.891
Don't! Someone might see.

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.018
You're too paranoid.

00:44:53.816 --> 00:44:55.359
You seem busy lately.

00:44:55.943 --> 00:44:56.985
Yes.

00:44:57.569 --> 00:44:58.654
Busy with work.

00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:00.030
You know how it is.

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:03.617
Oh, you're working.

00:45:07.496 --> 00:45:09.498
Okay. I'll go ahead.

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:25.639
Morning!

00:45:26.306 --> 00:45:27.349
Morning!

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:30.686
Hey. I have a question for you.

00:45:31.019 --> 00:45:32.020
What is it?

00:45:33.856 --> 00:45:38.068
Do you know the feeling
that there's something wrong?

00:45:39.445 --> 00:45:41.488
But you don't know why.

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:47.286
What do you mean?

00:45:47.953 --> 00:45:49.830
Like there's something
going on with Ramon.

00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:54.626
Last night, when I got home,
he was already asleep.

00:45:55.169 --> 00:45:58.297
But the bed smelled
like a woman's shampoo.

00:45:59.214 --> 00:46:00.299
And...

00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:03.177
Look.

00:46:03.218 --> 00:46:04.720
I saw this on the table.

00:46:04.928 --> 00:46:05.971
Whose is that?

00:46:07.973 --> 00:46:09.349
I don't know.

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.019
It's not mine.

00:46:15.522 --> 00:46:17.232
You're really quiet, huh?

00:46:18.233 --> 00:46:20.986
Sorry. I don't know
what to say.

00:46:22.696 --> 00:46:26.533
Anyway, I'm sorry
for inconveniencing you.

00:48:21.023 --> 00:48:22.107
Shit!

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:23.567
Damn it!

00:48:27.946 --> 00:48:28.989
Why?

00:48:30.782 --> 00:48:31.825
Damn it!

00:48:53.305 --> 00:48:54.765
Damn it!

00:48:56.391 --> 00:48:58.143
Damn it!

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.107
Damn it!

00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:15.702
What do you think of me?

00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:18.538
An idiot?

00:49:19.414 --> 00:49:21.333
I read all of it, Ramon!

00:49:22.167 --> 00:49:23.502
All your messages!

00:49:25.379 --> 00:49:26.713
You even took pictures!

00:49:27.214 --> 00:49:29.883
You didn't even bother
deleting them, huh?

00:49:33.095 --> 00:49:35.847
You didn't even think
about me?

00:49:37.599 --> 00:49:44.398
You know, I'm so tired
from working so many shifts.

00:49:45.983 --> 00:49:48.568
You didn't even think
about what I felt?

00:49:52.239 --> 00:49:53.365
Not just one.

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:54.992
There are many more.

00:49:56.118 --> 00:49:57.244
What's with that?

00:49:58.161 --> 00:50:02.165
Every week, there's a new one?
Huh? Damn you!

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.381
Why can't you look at me now?

00:50:09.965 --> 00:50:11.383
Is it because it's true?

00:50:13.051 --> 00:50:15.387
Is it true? Tell me!

00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:20.392
I gave everything to you.

00:50:22.019 --> 00:50:23.562
Everything you wanted.

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:27.733
Nobody else took care of you!

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:30.736
Just me!

00:50:32.237 --> 00:50:34.698
It hurts so much.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.243
Mara.

00:50:39.911 --> 00:50:40.996
Mara, I'm sorry.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.959
Say that to your other women!

00:50:47.252 --> 00:50:48.295
Me?

00:50:49.087 --> 00:50:50.881
I don't want this anymore.

00:50:51.506 --> 00:50:53.008
Let's end this.

00:51:38.345 --> 00:51:39.763
Damn it!

00:51:40.013 --> 00:51:41.640
I'm so useless!

00:51:57.906 --> 00:51:58.907
Damn it!

00:52:09.709 --> 00:52:10.836
Damn it!

00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:12.587
Damn it!

00:52:30.438 --> 00:52:31.523
- Whatever.
- Lea!

00:52:38.196 --> 00:52:39.197
Wait!

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:52.586
Sorry.

00:52:56.214 --> 00:52:58.300
Sorry. Did I wake you up?

00:52:58.758 --> 00:52:59.801
No.

00:53:01.887 --> 00:53:03.722
I don't know where I should go.

00:53:05.223 --> 00:53:07.058
Why? What happened?

00:53:10.395 --> 00:53:11.396
She's gone.

00:53:12.397 --> 00:53:13.398
She left.

00:53:15.942 --> 00:53:17.402
I can't blame her.

00:53:19.654 --> 00:53:20.989
Why are you here?

00:53:24.826 --> 00:53:25.827
I don't know.

00:53:40.008 --> 00:53:46.932
Have you ever felt like
you don't belong here

00:53:47.015 --> 00:53:50.852
but you have no where else to go?

00:53:51.686 --> 00:53:52.687
Always.

00:53:53.146 --> 00:53:55.899
I thought you love her?

00:54:00.528 --> 00:54:01.571
I love her.

00:54:03.198 --> 00:54:04.532
I still love her.

00:54:07.786 --> 00:54:09.162
But, it's so bland.

00:54:13.124 --> 00:54:14.668
I thought that's what I'm looking for.

00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:16.962
But, it's not.

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:19.673
You know what?

00:54:20.131 --> 00:54:21.174
You're just drunk.

00:54:24.636 --> 00:54:26.236
I'm sober enough
to know what I'm saying.

00:54:32.394 --> 00:54:33.770
Lea, I want to forget.

00:54:37.274 --> 00:54:38.275
Me too.

00:57:14.639 --> 00:57:15.723
You're leaving?

00:57:18.893 --> 00:57:19.936
Yes.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.648
Where are you going?

00:57:27.569 --> 00:57:28.695
To Batangas.

00:57:29.279 --> 00:57:30.321
Mara is there.

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:33.908
I need to talk to her.

00:57:34.826 --> 00:57:36.494
We might be able to fix this.

00:57:37.912 --> 00:57:39.914
Do you think she
will still accept you?

00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:43.626
I don't know.

00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:46.713
But I need to try.

00:57:47.881 --> 00:57:50.175
Aren't you going to
say goodbye to me?

00:57:52.886 --> 00:57:53.928
What for?

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:56.473
For me!

00:57:56.681 --> 00:57:58.349
Lea, you can handle yourself.

00:58:01.519 --> 00:58:02.520
Can I really?

00:58:12.071 --> 00:58:13.323
Lea, I'm sorry.

00:58:15.617 --> 00:58:17.243
I didn't mean to hurt you.

00:58:17.452 --> 00:58:18.578
You wanted that.

00:58:19.579 --> 00:58:21.080
You just don't care.

00:58:24.083 --> 00:58:25.335
Lea, you're still young.

00:58:27.253 --> 00:58:28.588
You'll forget me eventually.

00:58:30.465 --> 00:58:33.218
Do you think I want to forget you?

00:58:35.386 --> 00:58:37.305
You need to forget me, Lea.

00:58:38.598 --> 00:58:41.017
You know what?
It's easy for you to say that.

00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:43.228
Because you're the one
leaving me behind.

00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:48.525
Lea.

00:58:53.154 --> 00:58:54.197
Okay.

00:58:55.573 --> 00:58:56.574
It's over.

00:58:57.283 --> 00:58:58.368
You enjoyed it.

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:01.579
Now, you need to leave.

00:59:02.163 --> 00:59:03.414
You'll go back to her.

00:59:03.915 --> 00:59:04.958
What about me?

00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:06.459
What about me?

00:59:07.335 --> 00:59:09.963
Am I just nothing to you?

00:59:14.008 --> 00:59:15.510
It's not like that, Lea.

00:59:16.261 --> 00:59:17.262
Then what?

00:59:17.929 --> 00:59:18.972
What am I?

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:22.267
I don't know.

00:59:23.643 --> 00:59:24.894
I didn't plan for this.

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:28.565
But you wanted it, right?

00:59:36.823 --> 00:59:39.450
You can't even think
of a reason for me.

00:59:42.662 --> 00:59:45.331
You shouldn't have knocked
on my door that night.

00:59:48.167 --> 00:59:49.210
I know.

00:59:51.296 --> 00:59:52.630
But I tried, right?

00:59:54.674 --> 00:59:56.759
Because all of that means
something to me, Lea.

00:59:58.344 --> 01:00:01.180
Just stay here.
Why do you have to leave?

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:04.309
If I won't leave now,

01:00:05.476 --> 01:00:06.936
then I won't be
able to leave at all.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:12.442
Don't leave.
Just stay here.

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:14.819
I can't.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:17.322
What?

01:00:24.078 --> 01:00:25.121
Fine.

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:26.456
Leave!

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:36.966
I'm sorry.

01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:53.936
Bring that down.
Oh, that was close!

01:02:55.521 --> 01:02:57.648
You're so handsome
when you lift things.

01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:58.691
Really?

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:01.611
- Hi, neighbor.
- Hello.

01:03:01.986 --> 01:03:04.572
Hello. We're the new tenants
in Ramon's apartment.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:05.823
Do you know him?

01:03:06.407 --> 01:03:07.533
Not much.

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:09.285
I'm Tin.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:11.454
He's Paolo, my boyfriend.

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:12.722
Lea.

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:14.999
Nice to meet you.
Sorry for being so loud last night.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.209
It's okay.

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:18.211
I'm really sorry.

01:03:18.544 --> 01:03:20.588
It's nice here.
It's quiet.

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:22.715
Yes. It's really quiet here.

01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:29.138
- Okay. I'll go ahead.
- Sure. Nice meeting you.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.557
- Come on, let's go.
- Your eyes...

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:33.518
They should only
be looking at me!

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:34.644
Of course.

01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:36.771
- Oh!
- Oh no!

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:43.486
- Can you do it?
- Yes, I can do it.

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:45.404
I'll be the one to hold this.

01:03:47.573 --> 01:03:48.634
- Can you do it?
- Can I get a kiss first?

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:49.659
Oh!

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.160
- Oh, you!
- That was one!

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.579
- Let's go!
- Next time, on the lips.

01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:55.122
Geez!

01:04:02.755 --> 01:04:04.257
- Geez!
- Can I get another kiss?

01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:08.444
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, you! Let's go!

01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:09.512
I told you...

01:06:38.452 --> 01:06:41.080
Paolo!
