WEBVTT

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.480
You came to our world
and killed yourselves.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.120
What is it that binds
these two together?

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.160
You will find Salt.
You will return her to us.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.600
You will advance the plans
to change your world.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.320
- That's impossible.
- Make it possible.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.720
We've tested the samples,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.760
but we've never tried Severance
on an adult Homo Amphibian.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.160
If we can use Salt,
I can end this war.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.520
You're something of a warrior
yourself,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.960
and yet full of despair.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.480
I lost someone.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.240
Barclay, run! It's a trap!

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.040
General, this is a UNIT operation,
you will withdraw.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.960
You will both walk towards us!

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.320
You are prisoners
of the British Army.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.600
You will surrender to us!

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.880
Open fire at my command.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.280
On my command, fire at will.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.200
Go.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.240
I'll find you!

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.520
You'll never swim alone.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.600
You'll never swim alone.
You will never swim alone!

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.960
Come on, boy.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.360
All right, mate?

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.800
{\an8}Come on, boy.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.200
..a pushover.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200
Is there more to this story?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.560
Now, despite the shock...

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.040
- Cup of tea?
- Yeah, go on, then.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.840
..the H2O Committee have
been quick to reassure us

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.920
that a panel of experts
are scripting every word...

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.680
CONCH WAILS

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.400
DOG BARKS

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.960
DOGS BARK

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.880
- You ate our dogs!
- You eat our fish.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.240
Well, you can't eat our dogs!

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.640
You can't eat our fish!

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.560
Our dogs are domesticated!

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.400
Our fish are family!

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.000
The Ambassador from Vietnam
would like it on record

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.840
that taking offence at dog meat
is racist.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.440
It's a distraction.
Aquakind are playing with us.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.200
What are they really doing?

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.880
MUG ECHOES ON DESK

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.720
I keep seeing him.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.640
Every day.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.840
Every time I go home.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.720
I'm just going to add
some zatar to the salad.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.240
You'll see. You'll like it.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.360
Why are you always so paranoid?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.240
I've worked too long
and too hard to compromise myself!

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.360
- Why can't this be enough?
- It doesn't have to be.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.160
And when you see him,
how does it make you feel?

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.440
Oh, happy, obviously.
I think it's great.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.760
Don't be stupid!

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.400
I know he's dead.
It's PTSD, as simple as that.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.280
I didn't come for a diagnosis,
I just need to know.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.920
I'm on 20mg of paroxetine -
can I double it to 40?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.280
Because I need to keep focused
for work.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.240
I'm sorry,
that's out of the question.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.560
I will have to sign you off.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.960
What for?

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.120
You're clearly unfit.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.840
With the greatest sympathy,
I can't risk you going back to work.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.960
We're on the edge
of a worldwide war,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.840
so I'm not going anywhere.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.400
I can't let you do that.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.240
I'm sorry, I've got no choice.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.120
I have to report this
to your superior.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.000
Your daughter is not your husband's.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.760
I beg your pardon?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.760
Elizabeth,
it's my job to know everything.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.960
So I know that you slept
with his best friend.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.880
The friend found someone else,
called Gillian,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.200
your marriage survived,
your secret is safe.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.040
Until now.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.400
So...

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.040
..prescription, please.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.440
All residents will evacuate
the waterside.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.120
Do not approach the water.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.400
Repeat, do not approach the water.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.960
The next meeting with Tide
is scheduled for 2100.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.520
What about Barclay? How is he?

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.280
Physically he's OK.
We're still investigating that.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.560
But the psyche evaluation
is complicated.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.600
I keep getting headaches.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.880
And this whistling sound.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.960
I've got a rash on my neck
and my legs ache.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.160
..quality good.
BPM and heart rate steady.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.360
Let's step it up.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.160
Let's give him a breather
then send him back down.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.240
You were eight kilometres
under the sea.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.320
Nothing survives that.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.880
You're something of a miracle,
Mr Pierre-Dupont.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.880
It's a marvellous surname.
Where's it from?

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.560
My father was French.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.000
Amazing.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.880
Is it? Yeah.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.760
People think it's posh.
The truth is, my dad was a builder.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.200
Well, he wasn't even that.
He was unemployed.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.160
Everything he earned,
he drank away, but, erm...

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.720
I reckon that's why I got into UNIT,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.720
cos I've got a posh surname
and all you lot are Oxbridge.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.360
If you weren't special before,
you are now.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.840
The most famous man in the world,
some say.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.560
Yeah, that's the problem.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.920
She made me so special,
and now she's gone...

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.560
..no-one knows what to do with me.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.240
PROTESTERS SHOUT AND JEER

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.200
You know, if they arrest me,
people will complain.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.320
And if they let me go,
people will complain,

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.960
and they won't just complain...

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.840
..they'll murder me.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.840
So they put me back in the hotel.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.800
It's just me.
Everyone else has been evacuated.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.240
It's like a prison.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.840
Cheers.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.240
I've had so many death threats,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.240
everything I eat or drink
has to be scanned.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.040
And I-I said to them,
"For how long?"

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.320
HE LAUGHS WEAKLY

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.080
They said the rest of my life.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.280
Very funny!

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.000
And it hurts.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.880
In my back, in my neck...

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.800
HE SIGHS DEEPLY

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.000
..in my lungs.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.000
It's the only place I feel good.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.680
Where?

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.120
In the water.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.640
The same word - severance.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.640
Buried so deep that it sends up
a red flag.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.360
Thank you. Good work.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.240
All the same, ma'am,
it can wait till tomorrow.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.840
You're not going to stay here
all night, are you?

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.560
- No.
- We've got trouble.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.480
Kate, I need access to all comms,
all screens to me,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.280
priority override, open link to
the T&P database, my name only.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.720
Granted. This is Professor Bello,
Tactics and Planning.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.600
- What have we got?
- You were right from day one.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.720
They were hiding it.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.200
You said so.
It's all been a distraction.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.240
The diplomatic talks
were just war games

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.880
while they were doing exactly
what we thought they'd do.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.000
Aquakind are melting the ice caps.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.360
EQUIPMENT BEEPS

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.160
They were clever.
We were searching with satellites,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.800
but we forgot how good
they are with water.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.440
They positioned a layer of
ice crystals at three kilometres

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.120
- to hide the heat.
- How did you find it?

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.240
We didn't.
They dropped the layer.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.720
They want us to see.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.400
What's the scale?

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.560
At this rate,
Antarctica will double its loss.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.480
Er, 300 billion tonnes
of ice per year.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.280
- Jesus!
- That's three trillion litres
of water.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.120
And worse than that,
the Prince Friedrich Ice Shelf...

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.960
..it vanished. Today.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.120
That should take years.
That should take decades.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.040
It melted in six hours.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.960
I think that was a declaration.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.720
What if they go beyond Antarctica?

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.000
What happens if they melt
all the ice in the world?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.360
Sea levels will rise
100 metres worldwide.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.040
And it's not just the water.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.760
All that carbon will be released
into the atmosphere.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.400
We will flood.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.440
We will drown.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.440
We will choke.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.320
They've won the war.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.280
What is ice
but water in the form of land?

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.120
We are restoring it
to its natural state.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.080
Hmm, well nevertheless, erm, with
respect, it must be noted that we...

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.120
You started this!

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.480
Humankind was melting the ice
long before we awoke.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.200
We have heatwaves underwater

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.440
caused by you,
so we are completing what you began.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.360
But with respect,
we do need to know...

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.720
But you started this.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.560
Nevertheless, I have to ask...

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.760
You started this.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.520
Yes, if we could just push...

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.240
This was started by you!

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.200
- I don't think it's appropriate...
- YOU MADE THIS HAPPEN!

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.400
We think your schedule
of five years might not be...

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.800
Five years is all you have.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.240
Yes, I think we might not
actually...

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.680
You have five years.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.520
Or all the water of the world
will be set free.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.280
And be certain of this...

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.040
..little people...

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.880
..this was never a war...

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.880
..this was an inconvenience.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.960
You were the dirt that gathered
while we were away.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.880
But now we have returned...

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.520
..and you will be cleansed.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.720
Five years.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.640
We can't clean a single river
in five years,

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.160
never mind the world.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.640
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I'm so sorry.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.840
- Come on, come on, it's fine.
- It's not.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.360
I know you had to do it,
I completely understand,

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.400
I told you, I told you, I told you.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.640
I completely understand. Come here.
Come on, it's fine.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.200
HE EXHALES
It's fine.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.800
We met over there.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.200
You were drunk.
SHE GIGGLES

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.720
No, I was just a little bit happy.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.960
Happy and lucky.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.920
Are we all going to drown?

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.200
Is...is that what's going
to happen?

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.800
Are all of us going to drown?

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.520
I don't know.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.560
You're their bloody friend!
Why are you always so useless?!

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.480
We had a visitor.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.640
From UNIT. He was one of your lot.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.200
He said, "What about you and Kirby?

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.080
"You're connected to Barclay
and tempers are high.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.400
"You won't be safe."

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.960
He said it's UNIT's job
to protect you.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.280
For life.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.280
He said,
"We can move you, you know?

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.040
"You can live in a safe house.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.960
"On higher ground.
One of those gated communities.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.840
- "With security..."
- But for how long?

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.240
The rest of our lives.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.760
Can I see you? Can I see you?

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.200
Absolutely. You can see us
whenever you want.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.680
You can see Kirby
absolutely any time.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.960
You have to believe me,
that's the first thing I said.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.800
- OK.
- I really did.
- OK.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.520
That's honestly what I said.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.880
OK, I believe you, I do.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.320
God, we can meet behind gates.
What's happened to us?

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.800
You fell in love with a fish! Sorry.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.040
Sure.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.280
Well, you did.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.360
Did you?

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.720
I don't know.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.280
I just keep thinking,
I wish I could hear her.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.680
What do you mean?

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.720
Salt.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.720
We had this connection.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.480
You said that to me once.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.680
But we did.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.440
I keep thinking, right...

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.880
..we're 60% water, right?

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.440
So, I'm-I'm-I'm 60% water.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.600
And whale song can travel
thousands of miles, so I thought...

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.840
..maybe she could hear me.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.240
Some of the lads are on my side.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.160
In what way?

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.120
Every night...

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.280
They got me a piece of tech
to override the cameras.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.840
Thanks.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.120
I didn't see anything.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.120
So every night, I've got eight hours
before the next shift.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.560
Every single night.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.920
HORN BEEPS ON UNLOCK

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.760
And I drive.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.360
I drive into the night...

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.000
..every night.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.680
And every night, I go to the coast.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.760
Like it's calling to me.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.240
The water.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.800
All night long.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.280
Because she is out there.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.400
Somewhere.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.840
In the night.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.200
In the water.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.240
In the dark.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.000
SALT!

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.720
Every night, I call her name.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.520
And I keep trying.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.000
Every single night.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.280
And I never, ever hear a thing.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.680
Just as we planned,
he's calling for her.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.760
Every night, he waits till dawn,
then he drives back,

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.880
hides in his hotel,

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.080
tries again the next night.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.320
But he doesn't get a response?

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.800
We don't talk much.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.600
- Thanks.
- I didn't see anything.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.080
But I'd say not.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.680
Maybe Salt has gone.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.720
Or maybe she can't hear him.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.600
He's on the English Channel.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.120
My government have put bafflers
in the water along the coast.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.480
Sonic disruption to interfere
with Aquakind communication.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.480
Maybe they're stopping Salt.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.920
Anything you can do?

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.920
I could ask for a pause.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.520
Then maybe she'd get through.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.760
And then...

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.400
..Severance.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.440
I never said yes.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.560
For the history books,
my name is not on this.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.120
Sorry, haven't got time.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.680
I need a signature on this.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.240
You didn't need to bring it
in person.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.720
I'd also like a word.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.160
If you could finish off, folks,
hmm? Thanks.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.200
Yes, sir.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.920
You need to be quick,
I really haven't got time.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.720
We have five years
to rebuild civilisation.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.120
What's Severance?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.480
- In what way?
- It's a word
picked up on comms.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.040
It was buried in one of Sir Keith's
final messages.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.920
Sad loss.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.080
He was a good man.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.040
He was murdered
and we don't know why.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.320
We do. The police were very clear.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.000
There was a protest
against privatised water.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.120
And I might remind you, Sir Keith
was not a member of this government.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.760
But the word Severance crops up
in your comms too.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.200
I'm sure it does,
it could have a thousand meanings.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.040
- You could call Brexit
a form of severance.
- But you don't.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.680
The word has only appeared
since the arrival of Homo Aqua.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.200
Its context has been scrubbed.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.520
Someone clever has tried
very hard to hide it,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.720
but my staff are really very good.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.360
Then what do you think Severance is?

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.320
You tell me.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.040
Is it some sort of weapon?

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.680
Oh, for God's sake! I can help.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.200
These are extraordinary days, sir.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.840
The pressures on you are immense.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.280
And at times like this, people can
panic, do the wrong thing.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.800
I thought, maybe, if you're in
too deep, if you need someone...

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.800
Trust me. There's always a way out.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.600
I can find it for you.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.520
I don't know what you mean.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.440
Good.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.800
Thank you, sir.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.000
And if I might say,
a task of this size is beyond you.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.880
The economy will collapse within
six months, you'll be voted out,

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.360
the next lot will storm into power
promising anti-Aqua legislation,

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.800
the war will begin all over again,
and on and on and on it goes,

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.640
but I will still be here.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.560
Waiting.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.320
And I promise you, Harry,
when you're out of office

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.960
and history has swept you aside,
there will be a reckoning...

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.360
..with me.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.760
PHONE BEEPS

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.760
PHONE BEEPS

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.920
PHONE BEEPS

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.120
And you can see here
this incredible shelf of ice,

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.560
thousands of tonnes
of frozen water...

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.760
- Oh, I'm coming.
- ..has just collapsed...

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.240
Thanks.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.640
Great, yeah.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.560
It's, er, just burger and chips,
but that's the funny thing,

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.160
hotel burgers are always good.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.200
Well, yeah.
It's cos they incinerate them.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.280
Cheap meat cooked to death,
you can't beat it.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.920
- Cheers.
- Cheers, then.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.400
DEVICE BEEPS

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.120
I fell asleep.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.040
SALT!

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.120
I called to you every night.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.640
I knew you'd be to the south
of the land, but I couldn't hear.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.120
You people are so funny
in your clothes.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.120
I thought I'd never see you again.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.360
We don't have much time.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.680
Oh, we could go anywhere.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.840
We can go down the coast or...

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.440
I don't know, anything,
anywhere, we could...

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.600
Your civilisation is falling.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.720
They're melting the ice.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.800
But I swear, they never told me
there were tides within tides.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.040
But you can still help humanity.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.120
Oh, for God's sake!
No-one listens to me!

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.200
I'm nothing!

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:31.520
Salt, you, you made me so special,

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.920
for one moment.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.280
And now look at us,
we're reduced to this.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.280
The tides still head towards you!

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.200
Currents are converging
and I don't know why,

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.760
but maybe it's for this.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.160
You've got to go back.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.600
- Salt, we can escape.
- Go back...
- Please.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.600
..and tell your people
to ask for Accord.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.400
Accord?

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.480
Tell your people to ask
Aquakind for Accord.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.360
The word carries an ancient weight
that every one of my kind

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.000
will have to respect.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.800
- What does it mean?
- If you know what it means,

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.320
there's every chance humankind
will try to stop you.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.680
But find the ones you trust.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.600
Send out a signal to the seas,
ask them for Accord

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.000
and we might just survive.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.400
- All of us.
- I don't understand...

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.960
No, no, stay! Please!

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.640
SALT!

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.720
She said Accord.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.880
Just that word, Accord.
And that's all I know.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.960
But it could help?

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.880
Well, I mean, don't ask me
to make sense of it, Kate.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.920
All I know is that I trust her.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.440
Accord, dictionary definition,
to give someone status.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.760
Or to be harmonious
or consistent with.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.200
I like harmonious.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.600
I'm loving harmonious.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.240
She could be showing us a way out.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.080
Barclay, mate, you don't half stink.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.000
Yeah, well, Shirley,
I've been in the sea, OK?

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.200
And I keep finding sand.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.880
If I can suggest...

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.760
Er, if we ask the governments
of the world permission to send

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:19.640
the signal to Aquakind, that's
three months of debate, at least.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.080
And then they'll say no.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.120
They'll do more than that,
they'll try and stop us.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.880
But we send Aquakind
parcels of information every day.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.440
Just basic diplomacy.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.880
So, I could...

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.120
..filter the word Accord
into the signal.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.120
- Disguised?
- Exactly.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.720
Use my eye-tracking,
it doesn't leave a key-print.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.280
And I don't think there's
a translator on the land

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.240
that would notice it.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.640
But in the eyes of Homo Aqua,
there's a convex eye-spot.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.480
They literally gather more light
than we do, which means that

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.920
if the word Accord is embedded
in the message...

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.760
..they'll see it.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.240
And then what?

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.560
We'll find out.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.680
It's a bit of a risk.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.600
Word is, the gathering of
195 nations are currently asking

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.680
how many nuclear strikes
the ocean can take.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.720
That's the risk.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.280
Yeah, but come on, we're UNIT.
That's what we do, isn't it?

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.320
We save the world.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.360
And if that means standing
against the government, so be it.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.040
The clerk from transport.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.400
Yeah, but I'm here
only by mistake, remember?

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.400
We're not completely beyond
the laws of the land.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.360
We could all be
arrested for treason.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.160
- OK.
- Fine.
- Good.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.960
What would Christofer say?

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.200
Make it happen.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.440
Yes, ma'am!

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.760
Cameras off. Sub rosa protocols.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.320
I will monitor your personal comms
for the next 30 years to make sure

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.280
not a word of this gets out,
is that understood?

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.400
Yes, ma'am.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.000
I've taken the word Accord
and packaged it, enhanced it

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.440
and hidden it, it's ready to go.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.680
I'll cross-channel it.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.480
And this will transmit
to all the oceans of the world.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.520
Press send!

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.440
How do we know they're listening?

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.080
We just have to hope, right?

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.080
SIGNAL BEEPS

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.240
SIGNAL BEEPS

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.640
SIGNAL BEEPS

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.120
SIGNAL BEEPS

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.320
SIGNAL BEEPS

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.640
SIGNAL BEEPS MORE RAPIDLY

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.160
ALARM BEEPS

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.000
Any word?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.600
No.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.360
The water's quiet.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.400
It's been days.

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.080
Maybe this Accord thing has
sent them back into hibernation.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.200
We should be so lucky.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.880
Then what are they doing?

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.920
It's strange, we've got nothing.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.480
It's silent out there.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.160
All across the ocean.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.720
And it wasn't the Accord signal.
Things went dead before we sent it.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:38.240
Running silent - that's what
they call it on submarines.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.600
When you turn the engines off
to avoid detection.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.560
Which means
they're planning something.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.120
Or hiding.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.360
Or scared.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.680
Scared of what?

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.920
Vamos!

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.720
Hay algo en el agua!

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.760
Vamos!

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.800
Fall in!

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.120
Here! There's hundreds of them!

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.880
Look, there's more in the water!

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.640
- Over here!
- Give me a hand!

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.680
Get him out!

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.760
NEWSREADER SPEAKING ON TV

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.080
UNTRANSLATED SPEECH

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.000
Even here, in the heart of London,
one thing is obvious.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.720
They're dying.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.000
Homo Aqua is dying.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.360
Yeah, but is it all of them?

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.680
Oh, my God. Is it everyone?
What about Salt?

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.520
All right, can I speak to Kate,
please?

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.760
Cos this isn't Accord,
this is something else.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.720
Every coastline in the world
is reporting the same thing.

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.600
The death of Homo Aqua.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.800
What have we got?

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.240
Some sort of viral infection.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.280
It's like the gills get blocked.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.600
I'd say, they shed scales like
we shed skin, but the shedding

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.960
has stopped, which means the excess
scales build up and they drown.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.640
All of them? Is this Homo Aqua
or Homo Amphibia too?

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.680
I think it's all of them.
But no other life forms.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.760
Only Aquakind.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.000
What about us, are we safe?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.840
That's the strangest thing.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.680
Careful.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.680
There's no danger.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.800
Not any more.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.280
It's like I'm finding the aftermath
of a virus without the virus itself.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.400
- Which means...
- A virus that's been designed.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.760
That's front line warfare.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.600
Viruses programmed to strike
and then decay, that's...

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.240
Oh, for God's sake.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.880
That's human technology.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.720
It was us.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.080
I didn't see it happening.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.880
Severance.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.680
Severance was the virus.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.880
What are your people saying? What's
the level of contagion out there?

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.600
Er, 90%, on first evidence.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.760
A 90% death rate worldwide.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.440
We think Aquakind are connected
by an algae network.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.840
This proves it.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.480
One virus has circled around
all the oceans of the world.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.680
Story of the human race.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.760
From the moment Homo sapiens
learnt to walk,

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.560
we meet a new species...

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.160
..we slaughter them.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.480
Ma'am.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.840
We've got a signal.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.600
It's in deep Aquanese.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.160
It's the same signal
repeated over and over again.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.400
I think it's an SOS.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.920
They're calling for help.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.480
Barclay, I'm sorry,
they need you at the Empress Hall.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.800
What for?

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.200
You're the Ambassador.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.520
Hana, that's gone.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.640
I'm nothing.
I'm the man who's literally nothing.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.560
The request has come
to revert to Day One.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.160
They say they want it as it was
for the final session.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.360
Who does?

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.840
Homo Amphibia.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.200
What, is it Salt? Is she alive?

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.520
I don't know.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.680
I'm sorry,
but this is a pivotal moment.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.160
I demand a seat.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.360
Do we know anything more...
about the virus?

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.760
How did it happen?

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.040
Nothing.
We have suspicions, but we can't...

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.800
we can't prove anything.
Good luck.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.040
Ma'am, there is a message
from Dr Bannerjee.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.000
- It says Priority One.
- Not now. Stay with Barclay.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.160
Tank is stable
and maintaining integrity.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.560
Open water lock one.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.840
We have three life forms.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.920
Identify them.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.640
Two Homo Aqua.
One Homo Amphibia.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.960
Which one?

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.520
Is it her?

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.120
I have come to inform mankind...

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.080
..the war is over.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.640
You have won.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.920
We are defeated.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.120
We grant you victory.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.680
I'm sorry.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.600
Barclay, stay on message.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.680
I'm so sorry.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.360
What happened down there?
What's it like?

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.880
We are destroyed.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.560
The virus brought fire
to the world of water.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.960
And we burnt.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.960
But you survived.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.280
One in ten.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.600
As if by design.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.320
I didn't know.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.920
I swear I didn't know.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.920
No, not you.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.400
But there are others.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:16.360
There are creatures in this room who
want a prize for winning the war.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.040
They desire our technology.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.920
But there are oceans,
unknown to you,

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.560
running deep beneath the mantle
of this world,

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.400
and we have sunk our prizes
deep down below.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.200
Lost to you.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.440
Forever.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.280
But more than that,

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.440
you had thought you had chosen
your weapons well,

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.000
because a virus contains no water.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.880
And yet...

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:58.000
..it rides the back of
a water molecule like a parasite

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.240
upon a host.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.240
And we can read.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.680
Every drop.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.440
Stained with these fingerprints
of yours.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:15.080
Water will find you...

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.880
..one day.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.400
But...the Accord.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.720
Will never happen.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.720
What was it?

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:57.040
It was a way of two species joining
and sharing and celebrating.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.680
Which is now lost.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.840
Barclay, the first offer, page 15.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.560
We can offer help.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.200
We would grant you land.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.240
There is a haven.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.000
It's a trench in the Pacific Ocean.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.600
3,000 kilometres long,

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.000
60 kilometres wide,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.840
and 12 kilometres deep.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.040
The deepest place on Earth.

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.600
This can be your home.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:38.040
We will protect your boundaries from
pollution and sound and viruses.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.480
And we can rebuild
our relationship...

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.920
..as two species on the same Earth.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.080
We can be friends.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.320
We will accept this offer...

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.080
..if you give this land
its true name.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.360
A hunting ground.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:23.040
We will live there in full
knowledge of what you will do to us.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.920
We will do whatever you want...

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.840
..because we are terrified of you.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.280
Thus ends the war.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.400
No... No, no.

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.640
No, there's more to say.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.160
Will I see you again?

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.960
Green Shoot protocols, everyone.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.720
Congratulations.

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.320
Or shame on us all.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.880
I'm not sure which.

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.720
FAINT RUMBLING

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.480
RUMBLING AND CREAKING

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.600
GLASS CRACKS,
WOMAN SHRIEKS

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.600
Everyone, get out!

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.080
PEOPLE SHOUT

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.920
Abandon the hall, everyone!
Out! Out!

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.240
COMMOTION

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.640
Move! Move!

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.320
Come on, let's go.
GLASS CREAKS

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.600
GLASS CRACKS
Yeah?

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.560
Mr Dupont, anything to say?

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.160
We won.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.880
How about that? Tell them we won.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.280
We won the war.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.440
Move! Move, move!

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.520
I need to find somewhere to live.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.120
I said to Lawrence,
"Kate could stay with us."

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.000
- He said no.
- Fair enough.
- You've never got on.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.240
- Ma'am?
- No.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.360
Oh, I keep thinking.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:23.840
The times when the Doctor
is nowhere to be seen.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.040
He said to me once,

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.600
"I save the human race,
I don't shape the human race.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.560
"You can get that wrong
all on your own."

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.600
Yeah.

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.960
- Ma'am, there's a message.
- I said no.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.600
I'm sorry, he insists.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.280
It's Dr Bannerjee. Barclay's doctor.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.800
He says it's Priority One.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.760
Kate Lethbridge-Stewart.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.280
Heroes

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.680
# I

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:12.920
# I will be king

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.280
# And you

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.680
# You will be queen

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.240
# Though nothing

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:38.120
# Will drive them away... #

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.800
PROTESTERS SHOUT

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.640
# We can beat them

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.280
# Just for one day

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.920
# We can be heroes

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.400
# Just for one day

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.360
# And you

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.440
# You can be mean

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.200
# And I

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.480
# I'll drink all the time

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.080
# Cos we're lovers

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:36.000
# And that is a fact

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.400
# Yes, we're lovers

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:47.960
# And that is that

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.600
# Though nothing

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.440
# Will keep us together

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.240
# We could steal time

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.560
# Oh, just for one day

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:19.240
# We can be heroes

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.000
# For ever and ever

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.280
# I... #

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.560
SALT!

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.600
# I can remember

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.680
# Standing

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.520
# By the wall

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.040
# And the guns

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.640
# Shot above our heads

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.240
# And we kissed

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:13.760
# As though nothing could fall

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.560
- # And the shame
- And the shame

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.760
# Was on the other side

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.760
# The other side

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.840
# Oh, we can beat them

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.480
# Forever and ever

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:44.240
- # Then we could be heroes
- Heroes

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.000
# Just for one day

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.840
# We could be heroes

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.680
# We could be heroes

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:18.240
# We could be heroes

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.040
# We could be heroes

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:32.440
- # We could be heroes
- We can beat them

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:37.000
# We could be heroes

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.720
# We could be heroes. #

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.400
No, no, no, no, no. No, no.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.120
Sorry? Is there something wrong?

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.720
It's just that bottle.
Could you go back and pick it up?

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.840
Could I what?

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:28.160
Could you go back and pick it up?

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.720
- What for?
- If you could.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.400
Thank you.

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.840
Sorry, love. It's gone now.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.240
Well, go back and pick it up.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.560
You pick it up.

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:45.280
I'm asking you, please,
to go back and pick up that bottle.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.960
And what if I don't?

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.680
Pick it up.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:56.040
I said, pick it up!

00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:59.760
Pick it up!

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.760
PICK...IT...UP!
