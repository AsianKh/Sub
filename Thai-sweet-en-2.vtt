WEBVTT

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.920
Where are we going now?

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.760
We're

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.920
going to...

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.720
Welcome to Thailand.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.440
Why didn't you two

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.280
make that "whoa" sound?

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.740
We haven't started shooting yet.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.120
Then I'll take you to

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.320
a very special restaurant in Thailand.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.080
Dinosaur egg.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.960
Black sand.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.360
Your teeth are all black.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.280
No, they're not.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.680
Black Teeth Restaurant.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.560
It's so white that it's glowing.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.640
Look at yours.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.800
Look, it's not particularly
bright on my side.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.340
Those things I sent you...

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.880
that you need to help me shoot,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.480
have you learned how to do it?

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.890
But it's mainly about the vibe.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.960
Look at me.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.400
I look very natural like this.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.000
Smiling.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.200
Look at me.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.720
You're not really...

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.440
You think you look natural,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.170
but actually

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.680
how it appears on camera

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.410
is like this.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.840
I said look at me,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.300
and then you're like this.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.440
No way.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440
Where? Let me see.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.320
I didn't capture it.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.600
But it's just like that.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.000
See how natural it looks?

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.320
You need to do dynamic poses with me.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.450
I need to do this too?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.320
You do your own cool pose.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.160
No, I can only learn and imitate.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.560
What?

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.020
Why do you keep doing that?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.320
I can't capture your clothes.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.120
My hairstyle today

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.920
is a sleep-friendly hairstyle.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.640
Why?

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.360
It won't get messy.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.490
It's already messy.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.800
Handsome Zhao and Pretty Mu.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.840
She'll only play around

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.760
for 10 more minutes.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.880
Then she'll be out of energy.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.640
I can force myself to stay energetic

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.700
and talk non-stop.

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.040
Talk about what?

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.280
Talking to yourself?

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.920
Talking to you.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.450
Talking to someone nearby.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.840
She'll only play around

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.970
for 10 more minutes.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.800
Are you sleeping?

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.080
I'm going to Thailand first.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.880
Stop talking.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.960
We're almost there.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.800
Let's go.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.279
I ran into a female celebrity

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.680
on the plane.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.459
What are you doing?

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.540
Touching up my makeup.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.880
Keep going.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.760
Zhao, are you going to eat
the in-flight meal later?

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.720
I won't eat it.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.560
Will I eat it then?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.120
You'll just fall asleep.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.380
Probably won't eat it.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.080
Don't keep trying to set me up

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.320
to feel sleepy.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.000
I won't fall asleep.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.040
I'm excited.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.240
Let's go.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.040
You need to look handsome.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.440
Okay.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.480
Let's go.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.560
I'm going to Thailand first.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.680
Do I look good?

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.540
Yes. Not puffy.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.260
Going back to Thailand again.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.560
Where are we going now?

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.440
We're going to...

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.840
Shanghai.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.240
How long did you keep this pose?

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.440
Hold on.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.080
Hold on!

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.640
Let's just go

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.400
and ignore him.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.720
Hold on!

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.360
Are you okay?

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.760
Are you okay?

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.440
Are you okay?

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.080
Are you okay?

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.560
No, let's do it together.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.720
Come on.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.960
Okay, together.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.720
Time to dance.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.120
Dance.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.200
Come on.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.080
Dance!

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.080
Dance!

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.640
Come on.

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:59.560
You need to join us.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.650
This is Thailand's welcome ceremony?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.760
No matter how sweet Thai coconuts are,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.490
they're not as sweet as
the looks between you two.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.720
There's more.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.960
There's more?

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.200
There's more.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.040
Welcome to Thailand.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.560
Welcome to Thailand.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.360
Thanks, bro.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.280
Welcome back to Thailand.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:30.800
Flowers.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.320
Welcome back to Thailand.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.180
Are you hungry?

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.040
Yes.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.720
Okay.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.560
Then I'll take you to

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.120
a very special restaurant in Thailand.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.360
What restaurant?

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.080
My restaurant.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.520
Then let's go.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.780
Okay, let's go.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.280
Let me.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.040
Okay.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.720
Welcome to Thailand.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.240
Back in Thailand again.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.040
Well...

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.840
We need some music in this car.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.280
Singing. Karaoke.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.520
Okay.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.360
Lin Sui, is this your car?

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.720
Of course not.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.240
Welcome to Thailand.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.440
Welcome to Thailand.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.200
Welcome to Thailand.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:33.840
What?

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.280
Bye.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.800
I'll play you

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.320
a Thai song I loved when I was little.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:47.800
Okay.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.040
Thai song?

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.120
Before... Mong kon orn aen...

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.400
What?

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:54.920
What?

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.040
Mong kon orn aen lae mong kon rong hai...

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.080
Is this Thai?

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.720
Yes.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.920
It's that song.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:06.840
I've heard it.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.680
Have you heard it before?

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.340
Yes, I have.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.240
Mong kon orn aen...

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.000
What is this?

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.240
I'm going to continue
taking photos of you.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.440
Mong kon orn aen...

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.080
Right?

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:23.880
Good.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.320
Nice.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.980
Good. Look this way a bit more.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.980
Sawadee krab (Hello).

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.520
It should be "kop kun krab (thank you)."

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.920
Kop kun krab (Thank you).

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.600
Why didn't you two

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.440
make that "whoa" sound?

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.900
We haven't started shooting yet.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.370
We haven't started yet.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.440
Let's reshoot!

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.400
We're here.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.880
Tell me,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.740
what kind of reaction
should we have when we get out?

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.000
It looks a bit like...

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.080
a mecha head.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.040
So fancy.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.080
Such a magnificent restaurant!

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.080
Come on, let's take a photo

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.080
for our check-in.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.040
Are we the first customers?

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.360
Yes.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.280
Wow.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:38.760
Let's go.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.720
Let's go.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.560
You look so beautiful.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.160
Okay.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.080
Hello.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.210
She's so beautiful.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.040
First,

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.040
you need to take

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.640
this lamp.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.080
This lantern is for you.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.320
Thank you.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.440
It's a place with a great atmosphere.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.640
It's like an escape room, right?

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.040
It's so cool here.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:36.800
Isn't it?

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.800
Hello.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.880
Wow.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.240
Okay.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.560
First, we have a welcome drink.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.560
This is our welcome drink.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.120
Gold dust.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.560
What's this?

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.640
Dry ice.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:12.960
And then,

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.920
you can drink it.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.320
I need to remove the base, right?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:18.880
Yes.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.080
Cheers.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.840
Cheers.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.520
Welcome to Thailand.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.720
Welcome to Thailand.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.480
Welcome to THAI SWEET.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.240
THAI SWEET.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.840
Try this first.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.120
What's this?

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.120
Just try it first.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.360
Try it first, then guess.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:40.840
I'm afraid.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.720
You try it first.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.960
Just eat it like this?

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.520
What's that expression?

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.930
What does that mean?

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.240
It has a mysterious flavor.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:01.960
What?

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.160
It's soft and bouncy.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.240
Pomelo jelly.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:10.720
Pomelo.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.360
Pomelo.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.520
Pomelo.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.360
Next we're having a...

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.160
bread.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:17.800
Bread?

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.640
It's very special.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.560
Next one, right?

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.040
Is it Thai bread?

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.840
Eyes of the dragon.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.480
Eyes of the dragon?

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.800
Ice of the dragon?

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.760
It's dragon...

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.720
Dragon's eye.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.480
Longan.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.120
Longan.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.520
Longan.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.560
Yes.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:34.960
Longan.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.600
Longan.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.400
Longan.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:42.880
Dragon hand.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.120
This is not longan.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.560
I think we've misunderstood.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.720
Eyes.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.800
Eyes of the dragon.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.360
Longan.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.640
Do you want to...

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.120
Light it?

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:57.640
I'm afraid to.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.240
No.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:58.920
You do it.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.650
I don't dare.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:05.960
Do you dare to do it now?

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.520
Yes.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.840
This is very cool.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.440
Right?

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.040
Let me tell you,

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.080
this is edible.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.040
Which one is edible?

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:24.680
The candle is edible?

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.120
This one.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.050
Is it chocolate?

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.080
No,

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.240
this is butter.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.000
How do you say butter in Chinese?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.760
Huangyou.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.720
Huangyou.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.840
Black butter? Never seen that before.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.200
Won't it turn your teeth
black after eating?

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:35.930
No, it won't.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.260
Try one. Let me see.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.200
Okay.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.600
There's also this inside.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.200
Let me see.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.170
There's cheese inside.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.120
Your teeth are all black.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:48.760
No, they're not.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.800
Take a look.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.210
That's why we have mirrors.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.560
So that's how it's designed.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.200
Come on.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.200
What's wrong?

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.210
This bread is quite delicious.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.480
The bread is good.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.720
The butter is salty.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.840
I'm going to make the next dish myself.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.480
I'll change my clothes first.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.880
Thank you.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.820
I know this one.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.720
Okay. First, there's a lobster.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.880
Lobster.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.840
Then there's a Thai-style steak.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.040
Are you ready?

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.900
Yes, I'm ready.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.120
Mike looks so charming

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.720
when he's focused.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.600
Yes.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.460
Do you think so?

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.730
Super charming.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.080
Zhao,

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.880
when can I taste

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.210
the food you cook for me?

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.560
Didn't I make you

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.290
stir-fried eggs and tomatoes?

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.280
You mean in the show?

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:19.880
Yes.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.780
Then I'll cook something for you.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.680
Let me serve you in person.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.140
What would you like to eat?

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.000
I don't need to eat anything.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.920
Just enjoy your cooking.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.600
Please sit down.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.100
I'm Avatar.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.440
Sit down.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.280
I know you too well.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.880
You just want to play around.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.600
Too sweet!

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:06.770
It's burnt, bro.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:09.640
Mike!

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.880
Look, I was watching you chat

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.400
and I forgot.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.160
I'm telling you...

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.359
I completely forgot!

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.720
It should be fine. You can cut it.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.319
You can just trim off the outer layer.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.920
It's fine.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:23.680
Do you really know how to cook?

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.440
I do.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.319
Add some butter for me.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.380
Turn down the heat.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:27.480
Okay.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.820
It's too burnt.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.160
It's fine. We can eat it.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:46.840
It's done.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:47.440
Done?

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.320
Okay.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.200
Try this first.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.020
It's okay. Let me do it.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.680
Thank you.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.720
It looks nice.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.400
It tastes sweet

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.600
because it has cream.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.720
Thai delicacy.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.280
It looks so delicious.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.440
This is lobster mousse.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.280
You made it look nice.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.520
The way you drizzled the sauce,

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.050
you've clearly practiced.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.800
I'm not joking.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.800
You've learned it for a long time.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.600
Not really.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.260
Delicious.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.960
Does it taste authentically Thai?

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.280
Yes.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:35.800
Yes.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.280
Right?

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.480
I never expected Mike to be so handsome,

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.280
cook such delicious food,

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.360
be so patient,

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.160
so dedicated to his work,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:43.680
and so charming.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.140
This restaurant will surely become famous.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.840
You guys.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:49.920
Come rest.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.880
Stop working.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.480
Alright.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.240
Good job.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.200
Well done.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.080
And you can eat...

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.440
this one first.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.280
Open this.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.640
Moonlight Box.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.560
Is it beautiful?

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.440
Yes, it is.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.960
It's so pretty.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.160
It even has gold foil.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.840
Dinosaur egg.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:16.880
Black sand.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.840
This is fish.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.280
Here's another beautiful one.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.840
Each of his dish designs
is quite interesting.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.320
Abalone.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.360
This is abalone.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.040
Black rose.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.640
This one is quite beautiful.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.240
Let me take a good photo of it.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.920
Open it.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.450
Okay. Then eat it like this.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.610
Eat it like this.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.000
How do I eat it?

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.960
Just eat it directly.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.560
Is this the only way to eat it?

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.200
This also has a sweet and sour taste.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.560
It's Thai flavor.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.480
Sweet and sour.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.040
Yummy.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.700
We're really good at
exploring restaurants together.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.720
And it has coconut.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.140
It's tasty.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.480
Can I eat this now?

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.560
Can I eat it now?

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.000
Yes. This is fish.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.440
This is delicious. It's also spicy.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.760
It's good, right?

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.320
There's a sword.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.400
Thank you, Zhao.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.240
This will make our teeth
black again after eating.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.840
Black Teeth Restaurant.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.640
Black Teeth Restaurant.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.840
So what do you think about my restaurant?

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.840
Any suggestions?

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.240
I do have a suggestion.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.900
It's about the presentation.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.120
Everything is too black.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.360
If I want to post on social media,

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.920
it's all black.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.840
You should have some other colors.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.600
But not white.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.920
Not white.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.200
You could add some purple.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.760
Black-purple, black-red.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.920
And silver, right?

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.650
Black-blue.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.440
Okay.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:07.560
Good.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.600
Do you want to go for a walk?

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.200
Or should we

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.640
continue eating?

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.240
We can go for a walk.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.480
Weren't we planning to go to...

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.200
Chinatown?

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:14.920
Chinatown.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:15.880
Chinatown?

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.920
The place where we filmed.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.760
Let's take a stroll there.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.440
Okay.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.600
Xin.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.120
I've prepared a surprise for you.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:21.880
You guys,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.840
turn around.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.520
Look.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.280
Let's go to Chinatown.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:37.640
Okay.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.200
Isn't this where we filmed?

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.800
Yes, this is the place.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.320
Right.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.640
I want to play Mu once.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.800
Let's switch roles.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.800
I want to play too.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:48.920
Zhao,

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.160
why don't you ever compliment me?

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.020
What exactly do you want me to say?

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:52.720
I miss you.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.680
Me too.
