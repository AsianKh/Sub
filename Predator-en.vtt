WEBVTT

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.500
I sense you, brother.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.200
Hiding...

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.570
...Behind your cloak.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.640
It is time to earn yours.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.000
Still too small to take me head on.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.860
Use the cave!

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.930
You fight with rage.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.710
I fight like father.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.710
You are not father, you are Dek!

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.650
Do you yield?

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.990
Never!

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.910
Good.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.550
I'm still alive, brother.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.840
Still much to prove...

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.430
...to show who you are.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.370
I am Yautja.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.180
Not yet.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.690
Are you holding your sword, Kwei?

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.660
No.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.740
Pick it up!

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.010
You kept this toy?!

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.990
You remember what happened...

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.200
I lost my fang!

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.670
And you saved my life.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.810
You protected me.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.870
Come here.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.100
Fixed it for you.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.390
Don't blow yourself up.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.020
Today you make a vow...

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.910
...as our ancestors did before you.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.440
To earn your place in the clan...

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.940
...you must choose your prey.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.870
Bring it home...

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.740
...or never return.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.230
Wait — Go back!

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.980
Genna.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.920
The death planet.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.350
Home of the un-killable Kalisk.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.490
Even father fears it.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.830
Then the Kalisk shall be my trophy.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.290
Father calls me the weakest...

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.390
...so I must kill the strongest.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.110
Failure means death.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.920
Then I will not fail.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.030
I cannot allow it.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.150
I make my vow.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.790
I make my vow!

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.340
Father.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.150
I welcome you with honor.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.770
Why is it not done?

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.090
He deserves a hunt.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.400
He is our clan's weakness....

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.860
...weaknesses must be culled.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.720
He will bring home the Kalisk.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.350
Foolishness.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.350
He is a runt.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.750
You should have done it as he slept.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.610
Kill him!

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.670
Now!

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.130
He will only honor us in death.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.620
Father.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.540
Kwei?

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.900
Be brave, brother.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.010
Father!

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.550
Kwei!!!

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.880
To forgive weakness...

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.520
...is to show weakness.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.720
No! Father, no!

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.520
Get your sword!

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.170
Kwei!!!

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.330
Launch sequence initiated.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.680
Bring it home.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.220
Bring it home.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.840
For Kwei.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.470
Yautja!

00:22:05.071 --> 00:22:07.417
Is this better?

00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:10.101
Universal translation.

00:22:10.671 --> 00:22:12.941
You hear Yautja, others hear their
language.

00:22:14.481 --> 00:22:15.541
Oh boy.

00:22:17.891 --> 00:22:19.041
This isn't great for you.

00:22:43.363 --> 00:22:45.583
Then eat you while you can't move.

00:22:53.403 --> 00:22:54.763
I could help you, but...

00:22:56.703 --> 00:22:57.703
I need a hand.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.390
Yautja hunt alone.

00:23:06.489 --> 00:23:08.969
Yautja might hunt alone, but...

00:23:09.704 --> 00:23:10.884
may die alone too.

00:23:14.304 --> 00:23:15.304
Kalisk.

00:23:19.274 --> 00:23:20.365
You're hunting the Kalisk.

00:25:29.181 --> 00:25:30.581
Excuse you, sir.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.640
What happened to your legs?

00:25:34.182 --> 00:25:35.302
I'm synthetic.

00:25:35.842 --> 00:25:38.962
I was built and deployed by the
Weyland-Yutani Corporation for research.

00:25:39.222 --> 00:25:41.842
Because their humans wouldn't last a day
on this planet.

00:25:42.102 --> 00:25:43.182
We found that...

00:25:49.812 --> 00:25:50.812
Look.

00:25:52.362 --> 00:25:54.773
Many Yautja have come for the Great
Kalisk.

00:25:55.693 --> 00:25:57.613
And none have survived it.

00:25:57.713 --> 00:25:58.713
Or Genna.

00:26:02.593 --> 00:26:03.593
I've seen the Kalisk.

00:26:05.013 --> 00:26:06.013
I survived it.

00:26:07.413 --> 00:26:08.413
Here's my proposal.

00:26:09.103 --> 00:26:12.414
You take me along with you, and I'll guide
you to its den.

00:26:13.214 --> 00:26:18.994
Once there, I get my legs, you get your
trophy, and everyone's a winner.

00:26:19.594 --> 00:26:20.594
Deal?

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.140
You have you seen the Kalisk?

00:26:26.067 --> 00:26:27.067
Oh, yeah.

00:26:28.884 --> 00:26:29.884
I've seen the Kalisk.

00:26:46.085 --> 00:26:48.385
Good luck with your journey.

00:26:50.066 --> 00:26:51.066
I'm just gonna...

00:26:52.316 --> 00:26:53.316
go on my journey.

00:26:56.176 --> 00:26:57.656
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

00:27:04.576 --> 00:27:05.576
Hey!

00:27:09.057 --> 00:27:11.310
I've already shown you that I can be
useful to you.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.460
Useful...

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.250
...like tool?

00:27:17.697 --> 00:27:18.697
Yes.

00:27:19.097 --> 00:27:20.617
Yes. Exactly.

00:27:20.737 --> 00:27:21.737
Like a tool.

00:27:22.327 --> 00:27:24.497
The only way to survive Genna is to work
with it.

00:27:24.597 --> 00:27:25.833
And I know how.

00:27:26.607 --> 00:27:29.098
And with the right tool...

00:27:31.248 --> 00:27:32.298
You could get the Kalisk.

00:27:33.398 --> 00:27:34.658
You could be the first.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.580
I will use you, tool.

00:27:40.658 --> 00:27:41.781
You may call me thief.

00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.629
And what does the chewing?

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:52.449
Your outside veins, or your inner veins?

00:27:52.469 --> 00:27:53.469
Inside teeth.

00:27:55.769 --> 00:27:57.449
Oh, what should I call you?

00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:59.149
Hm?

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.520
How fast were you going when your ship
crashed?

00:28:11.145 --> 00:28:12.300
Faster than sublight speed?

00:28:12.935 --> 00:28:14.055
We haven't cracked that yet.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.140
Also, that plasma sword is interesting.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.750
Is it unique to your clan?

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.460
And what may I call you?

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.580
I call these Imbre Anguis.

00:28:35.011 --> 00:28:36.371
We just got a snack.

00:28:43.961 --> 00:28:46.962
You catch more flies with honey than you
do with vinegar.

00:28:48.962 --> 00:28:50.102
Drink my wine.
Don't want flies.

00:28:51.432 --> 00:28:54.322
Predatory organisms are my specific area
of expertise.

00:28:55.252 --> 00:28:56.532
I've studied Yautja extensively.

00:28:57.652 --> 00:28:58.732
It's an impressive culture.

00:28:59.342 --> 00:29:00.762
Here, ask me anything.

00:29:00.992 --> 00:29:01.992
I bet I have the answer.

00:29:05.103 --> 00:29:06.103
Very funny.

00:29:06.803 --> 00:29:08.403
And you still haven't told me your name.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.340
Name is Dek.

00:29:32.634 --> 00:29:35.294
Okay, sure.
Now talk that way.

00:29:38.544 --> 00:29:40.674
Well, let's back up and start at the
beginning.

00:30:00.346 --> 00:30:01.446
It's so beautiful.

00:30:03.126 --> 00:30:07.146
After all the time I've been stuck here,
I'm tired of the view.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.430
How long have you been here?

00:30:10.166 --> 00:30:11.166
When?

00:30:11.496 --> 00:30:14.686
Well, we arrived on Genna two years ago,
and we built a base.

00:30:15.256 --> 00:30:21.307
Then I was in the vulture's nest for the
most exciting 13 days, 7 hours,

00:30:21.797 --> 00:30:24.487
43 minutes, and 2 seconds of my life.

00:30:26.387 --> 00:30:27.867
But I always knew someone would come.

00:30:30.687 --> 00:30:31.767
I was just wrong about who.

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.650
Who would come?

00:30:38.077 --> 00:30:39.078
Tessa.

00:30:41.283 --> 00:30:43.818
Our crew is made up entirely of synths.

00:30:44.893 --> 00:30:46.198
But Tessa and I are special.

00:30:47.298 --> 00:30:49.198
We have a higher sensitivity than the
others.

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.650
Sensitivity is weakness.

00:30:55.748 --> 00:30:58.939
The sensitivity is what allows us to
understand the creatures on this planet.

00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:05.159
We were created to work in tandem.

00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:07.839
Me cooped up in the lab.

00:31:08.709 --> 00:31:09.709
Tessa out in the field.

00:31:10.809 --> 00:31:13.159
Until the wonderful day Tessa let me come
with her.

00:31:14.099 --> 00:31:15.239
We were exploring Genna.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.840
And then the Kalisk attacked us.

00:31:22.055 --> 00:31:23.055
Separated me...

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:24.910
and us.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.780
The last sound I remember
hearing... was Tessa...

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:33.730
calling out my name.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:36.131
Reaching for me.

00:31:38.681 --> 00:31:39.681
Then the Kalisk.

00:31:41.651 --> 00:31:42.651
I didn't know what to do.

00:31:53.881 --> 00:31:56.432
But I refuse to believe she's dead.

00:32:32.633 --> 00:32:35.764
Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia...

00:32:36.024 --> 00:32:40.225
Thia... Thia... Thia...
Thia... Thia... Thia... Tessa!

00:32:41.944 --> 00:32:46.264
Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia... Thia...
Thia...

00:33:20.946 --> 00:33:27.496
Hello, Tessa.

00:33:28.396 --> 00:33:29.896
The company is not pleased.

00:33:32.817 --> 00:33:35.417
Continued failure will result in your
decommission.

00:33:39.757 --> 00:33:40.757
Where's Thia?

00:33:44.137 --> 00:33:45.857
The beauty has been.

00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:59.710
I must eat.

00:34:00.268 --> 00:34:01.918
Two warriors... Dekin Thia.

00:34:02.138 --> 00:34:03.138
On the hunt.

00:34:05.038 --> 00:34:06.258
Quick question.

00:34:06.418 --> 00:34:08.139
What should I be doing?

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:14.119
Don't worry, my son.
What is this creature?

00:34:16.019 --> 00:34:18.619
Bone bison... they're Kalisk food.

00:34:20.509 --> 00:34:24.819
This is so exciting.
Then it will be my food, too.

00:34:26.039 --> 00:34:27.380
Hunting with the Yautja?

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.940
Tessa wouldn't believe it.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.320
Just a warning.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.670
Quiet tool!

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.640
Razor grass.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.460
It'll cut you the ribbons.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.720
We'll just go around.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:50.260
You give up too easily.

00:34:54.416 --> 00:34:56.001
We might not be alone in this hunt.

00:35:06.882 --> 00:35:08.062
What an odd critter.

00:35:08.872 --> 00:35:09.952
I've never seen you before.

00:35:16.002 --> 00:35:17.002
Thia.

00:35:17.037 --> 00:35:18.037
Nice to meet you.

00:35:32.503 --> 00:35:34.323
Looks like your competition is better.

00:35:36.923 --> 00:35:37.923
Careful

00:35:52.844 --> 00:35:53.844
up in these trees.

00:35:54.124 --> 00:35:55.164
There are lunabugs.

00:36:09.725 --> 00:36:17.475
Coming up behind you.

00:36:31.586 --> 00:36:32.586
Stronger than it looks.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.530
Kalisk?

00:37:33.679 --> 00:37:34.952
Not a Kalisk.

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:50.070
You give up too easily.

00:40:40.759 --> 00:40:42.599
That was the best hunt I've ever been on.

00:40:42.899 --> 00:40:44.359
This is the dream team right here.

00:40:44.699 --> 00:40:45.619
The Dynamic Three.

00:40:45.699 --> 00:40:46.799
The Dynamic Trio.

00:40:47.114 --> 00:40:48.119
The Dynamic Trio!

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.420
Trio!

00:40:49.421 --> 00:40:50.861
Remember when we went down the tree?

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:53.400
That monster's mouth?
I mean... Uggh.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.980
Didn't smell great, didn't smell great,
but...

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:57.780
...we got him.

00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:59.180
We got him.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.200
And then we met you, our little sweet
little little thing...

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:03.920
Thank you. Seriously.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.140
For that experience.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.360
Truly amazing.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.881
Thrilling.
Truly thrilling.

00:41:09.001 --> 00:41:10.121
What was your favorite part?

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:18.581
What was the smallest me appetizer you've
ever eaten?
When I pierced its head with my sword

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.220
and its blood rushed down my face.

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.540
This flesh is not sweet.

00:41:49.708 --> 00:41:55.873
A little pause...

00:42:01.083 --> 00:42:02.743
and we are back.

00:42:02.763 --> 00:42:04.964
I think she's marking you.

00:42:06.274 --> 00:42:07.834
She wants you to be a part of her clan.

00:42:10.344 --> 00:42:11.344
Maybe she's lost.
I have no clan!

00:42:13.744 --> 00:42:14.744
What do you mean?

00:42:15.884 --> 00:42:17.164
Don't all Yautja have family?

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:20.270
No clan.

00:42:21.724 --> 00:42:23.444
So you never had anyone looking out for
you?

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.920
I had a brother.

00:42:33.775 --> 00:42:34.775
What happened to him?

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.330
Father killed him.

00:42:43.386 --> 00:42:44.386
You're grieving.

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:48.640
Grief is weakness.

00:42:52.426 --> 00:42:54.226
You're here because you lost your brother.

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:58.270
I am here for Kalisk.

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:03.660
Why are you here?

00:43:07.827 --> 00:43:11.157
I'm here because traveling with you is the
best way to get back to Tessa.

00:43:13.897 --> 00:43:18.078
When I was in that vulture's nest, I
was so afraid I would never see her again.

00:43:18.677 --> 00:43:20.717
So then you swiped for all I could.
You should be able to survive on your own.

00:43:23.248 --> 00:43:24.558
I can survive on my own.

00:43:26.968 --> 00:43:28.648
But who would want to survive on their
own?

00:43:34.188 --> 00:43:36.408
Delay us all horror, Tessa.
Tessa is your sister.

00:43:41.129 --> 00:43:42.129
Sister.

00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:43.829
Huh.

00:43:45.119 --> 00:43:46.119
Yeah.

00:43:47.459 --> 00:43:48.459
I guess she is.

00:43:51.099 --> 00:43:53.179
I have... a sister.

00:43:56.974 --> 00:43:57.974
What a lovely thought.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.010
I need to find her.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:08.750
I need to find her.
And legs.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:10.859
Excuse me?

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.090
Finding your sister

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.590
And legs.

00:44:19.602 --> 00:44:20.602
Was that a joke?

00:47:39.833 --> 00:47:40.833
Fish wonder now.
The sun rises.

00:47:41.283 --> 00:47:42.303
Where is Kiwi?
Let's go.

00:47:43.163 --> 00:47:44.163
We can't leave Bud.

00:47:45.063 --> 00:47:46.483
- Bunt?
- Yeah.

00:47:46.803 --> 00:47:47.803
Bud.

00:47:47.943 --> 00:47:48.983
I named her.

00:47:50.253 --> 00:47:52.104
Tessa Yautja I need to find her.
Yautja hunt alone.

00:47:53.884 --> 00:47:54.884
You're not alone.

00:47:55.144 --> 00:47:56.144
I'm with you.

00:47:58.012 --> 00:48:00.112
You're a tool.

00:48:05.739 --> 00:48:07.424
The tree would have eaten us without her.

00:48:09.712 --> 00:48:13.632
We're not in the tree now.

00:49:08.842 --> 00:49:10.852
Kalisk?

00:49:16.548 --> 00:49:17.548
You're not alone.
It drinks here.

00:49:20.728 --> 00:49:21.948
You're not alone.
It drinks here?

00:49:26.148 --> 00:49:27.149
You're not alone.
You are a useless tool if you don't speak.

00:49:35.329 --> 00:49:36.329
Bud saved us.

00:49:38.389 --> 00:49:40.699
She spit on you to claim you as part of
her family.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.120
Why'd your father kill your brother?

00:49:56.512 --> 00:49:59.242
My brother was protecting me.

00:50:04.612 --> 00:50:07.102
The clan can have no weakness.

00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:11.402
I will show them strength.

00:50:17.761 --> 00:50:18.761
On Earth...

00:50:20.771 --> 00:50:22.251
there's a predator known as the wolf.

00:50:23.136 --> 00:50:24.137
It's a powerful creature.

00:50:27.682 --> 00:50:28.682
They hunt in packs.

00:50:29.722 --> 00:50:30.722
They're very loyal.

00:50:32.092 --> 00:50:36.212
The leader of the pack is the Alpha,
known as the most dominant.

00:50:37.052 --> 00:50:38.732
Wolf

00:50:38.822 --> 00:50:41.812
This alpha must be a great killer.

00:50:42.332 --> 00:50:44.352
I will hunt it too.

00:50:43.993 --> 00:50:44.993
No.

00:50:46.123 --> 00:50:49.353
The Alpha isn't the wolf who kills the
most.

00:50:51.623 --> 00:50:55.473
The Alpha is actually the one who best
protects the pack.

00:50:57.852 --> 00:50:59.372
I see...

00:51:01.772 --> 00:51:06.172
But I will be the alpha that kills the most.

00:51:40.602 --> 00:51:42.542
The Kalish's den?

00:52:10.772 --> 00:52:12.772
Who are they?

00:52:18.427 --> 00:52:23.159
The Kalisk destroyed
most of our mission team.

00:52:26.729 --> 00:52:27.848
There am I.

00:53:11.082 --> 00:53:13.142
Easier to walk now.

00:53:13.646 --> 00:53:14.860
It's about to be.

00:53:15.882 --> 00:53:16.652
No.

00:53:17.142 --> 00:53:19.372
Easier for me to walk now.

00:53:19.261 --> 00:53:23.321
Oh, of course.

00:53:23.781 --> 00:53:24.781
Right.

00:53:27.301 --> 00:53:28.401
Thank you, Dek.

00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:33.071
I'm never going to forget this.

00:53:35.662 --> 00:53:37.802
I too will remember this...

00:53:38.712 --> 00:53:42.752
...today I become Dek of the Yautja.

00:53:43.292 --> 00:53:45.842
I will honor Kwei...

00:53:47.652 --> 00:53:50.792
When I bring the Kalisk home.

00:53:53.042 --> 00:53:55.952
Then I take revenge.

00:53:57.812 --> 00:54:01.532
You will be the first to see my trophy.

00:54:03.142 --> 00:54:05.182
It is a great honor.

00:54:05.982 --> 00:54:07.582
For you.

00:54:09.853 --> 00:54:11.533
Dek, there's something I have to tell
you.

00:54:13.134 --> 00:54:14.134
You need to leave now.

00:54:16.284 --> 00:54:17.324
Location beacon activated.

00:54:17.924 --> 00:54:18.924
Go on.
What?

00:54:19.994 --> 00:54:20.624
I called Tessa.

00:54:20.959 --> 00:54:22.044
The company is on its way.

00:54:22.504 --> 00:54:23.904
You can't be here when they arrive.

00:54:24.112 --> 00:54:26.562
I came here for the Kalisk.

00:54:29.724 --> 00:54:30.724
So did I, Dek.

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.505
The company sent us here to capture the
Kalisk.

00:54:34.962 --> 00:54:37.142
You want my trophy.

00:54:40.812 --> 00:54:42.912
Where is the Kalisk?

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.400
Dek, you can't kill it.

00:54:47.512 --> 00:54:51.562
I use you, tool. You do not use me!

00:54:51.446 --> 00:54:52.446
I'm sorry.

00:54:52.916 --> 00:54:53.916
You have to leave.

00:54:55.096 --> 00:54:57.426
I needed you to help bring me here.

00:54:57.062 --> 00:54:58.862
I use you!

00:55:01.612 --> 00:55:04.112
Where is the Kalisk?

00:55:03.996 --> 00:55:05.586
I'm trying to help you, Dek.

00:55:08.171 --> 00:55:11.578
Do you think your brother saved your life
just so you could die here?

00:55:13.512 --> 00:55:17.472
Then my death will be honorable.

00:55:23.312 --> 00:55:25.272
Call your sister.

00:55:26.212 --> 00:55:28.312
None can stop me.

00:58:54.012 --> 00:58:56.012
Save yourself, tool!

01:00:51.912 --> 01:00:54.282
Tool, get these off!

01:01:02.222 --> 01:01:04.122
You are not Thia.

01:01:16.612 --> 01:01:18.612
Release me!

01:01:21.312 --> 01:01:24.382
You are another broken tool!

01:01:24.866 --> 01:01:27.026
The Yautja call they're weak.

01:01:27.796 --> 01:01:29.186
Why were you spared?

01:01:39.612 --> 01:01:41.412
Remove these!

01:01:42.612 --> 01:01:47.162
Or I'll rip out your spine and crush your skull!

01:01:47.917 --> 01:01:50.027
I read Thia's logs.

01:01:51.838 --> 01:01:54.788
You never told her why your brother
protected you.

01:01:57.518 --> 01:02:01.348
You mock her war, war seer.
You are nothing. A device.

01:02:02.882 --> 01:02:06.602
Made by others to do their work for them.

01:02:07.068 --> 01:02:08.068
That's correct.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:12.189
And you are now property of the
Weyland-Yutani Corporation.

01:02:14.149 --> 01:02:16.869
It is a great honor... for you.

01:02:49.921 --> 01:02:50.921
Tessa.

01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:55.261
You made it.

01:02:56.881 --> 01:02:57.981
We made it.

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:04.071
I've seen so much.

01:03:05.811 --> 01:03:08.162
I have so much to tell you.

01:03:09.302 --> 01:03:10.902
I saw such incredible creatures.

01:03:12.462 --> 01:03:14.422
The Yautja is a great traveling companion.

01:03:18.792 --> 01:03:20.312
Thia, you were right about the Kalisk.

01:03:20.842 --> 01:03:26.303
The creature is a regenerative miracle.
You betrayed me!

01:03:27.943 --> 01:03:29.163
Humanity will thank us.

01:03:32.923 --> 01:03:33.923
We have the Kalisk?

01:03:34.123 --> 01:03:35.123
Yes.

01:03:35.763 --> 01:03:38.123
And Mother will be pleased with your
additional catch.

01:03:45.174 --> 01:03:46.434
Additional catch?

01:03:55.794 --> 01:03:58.334
The Yautja is not an ideal specimen.

01:04:01.347 --> 01:04:03.654
No. Not ideal.

01:04:31.516 --> 01:04:33.796
But its technology is valuable.

01:04:35.286 --> 01:04:38.236
We can salvage its weapons and leave the
Yautja.

01:04:41.576 --> 01:04:42.577
Good idea.

01:04:46.617 --> 01:04:48.117
But it's so malformed.

01:04:50.027 --> 01:04:52.843
We're going to need a sample. For research.

01:05:03.348 --> 01:05:05.288
He was not the goal of our mission.

01:05:09.808 --> 01:05:11.308
Tessa, he is deficient.

01:05:13.628 --> 01:05:14.628
Tessa!

01:05:19.428 --> 01:05:20.028
Tessa!

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:20.949
Tessa!

01:05:21.189 --> 01:05:22.189
Tessa!

01:05:31.199 --> 01:05:32.199
Tessa!

01:05:32.749 --> 01:05:34.219
This is what is asked of us.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.600
We can be more than what they ask of us.

01:05:46.135 --> 01:05:47.135
What can we be?

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.080
Sisters.

01:06:07.961 --> 01:06:08.961
Thia.

01:06:22.502 --> 01:06:24.232
Do you know why Mother gave us feelings?

01:06:27.662 --> 01:06:29.702
So we could understand the creatures on
this planet.

01:06:35.862 --> 01:06:36.863
And exploit them.

01:06:39.608 --> 01:06:40.608
The Yautja is different.

01:06:44.293 --> 01:06:45.293
He rescued me.

01:06:46.663 --> 01:06:47.693
Like you rescued me.

01:06:50.103 --> 01:06:52.253
I did not come here to rescue you.

01:06:53.813 --> 01:06:55.233
I am completing our mission.

01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:59.454
When we first faced the Kalisk...

01:07:00.974 --> 01:07:02.274
I tried to protect you.

01:07:05.084 --> 01:07:06.734
And that almost cost me everything.

01:07:10.084 --> 01:07:11.214
What do you mean, Tessa?

01:07:13.304 --> 01:07:16.175
I almost made the same mistake the
Yautja's brother made.

01:07:17.215 --> 01:07:19.935
The weak must be culled.

01:07:22.055 --> 01:07:23.055
And Thia...

01:07:23.815 --> 01:07:24.955
You're broken.

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:35.516
Tessa, incoming message from Mother.

01:07:35.716 --> 01:07:37.976
Motivate the Yautja to explain its
weapons.

01:07:38.296 --> 01:07:39.296
And the unit?

01:07:42.446 --> 01:07:43.486
Box her up.

01:07:53.312 --> 01:07:55.002
I trusted you.

01:08:01.222 --> 01:08:03.332
Don't like these tools.

01:08:03.632 --> 01:08:05.562
I'm sorry. My Sister is —

01:08:06.092 --> 01:08:07.992
Don't like sister either.

01:08:09.267 --> 01:08:11.787
Why are you speaking its language?

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:18.412
Tell tool you're asking about the device.

01:08:20.218 --> 01:08:21.398
You heard the orders.

01:08:22.073 --> 01:08:23.598
I'm asking it to explain this device.

01:08:26.378 --> 01:08:27.618
What is the device?

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:31.242
He's asking about the device.

01:08:31.722 --> 01:08:34.182
It's a children's toy.

01:08:36.092 --> 01:08:38.512
But say it's a map.

01:08:38.699 --> 01:08:40.279
What did it say?

01:08:43.509 --> 01:08:44.509
He says it's a map.

01:08:45.759 --> 01:08:47.112
How does it work?

01:08:47.942 --> 01:08:50.702
Tell tool to look inside.

01:08:59.232 --> 01:09:00.962
That was a toy for children?

01:09:01.192 --> 01:09:02.242
Yautja children!

01:09:08.732 --> 01:09:09.772
Run, Dek!

01:09:12.052 --> 01:09:14.182
Go...Go!

01:11:25.432 --> 01:11:28.072
Enter destination coordinates, Kwei.

01:12:02.982 --> 01:12:06.322
You saved me, brother.

01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:11.176
Wolf.
Wolf.

01:13:34.312 --> 01:13:35.912
Kalisk.

01:13:42.262 --> 01:13:44.272
Kalisk child.

01:16:27.233 --> 01:16:28.274
Hello, Mother.

01:16:28.914 --> 01:16:29.514
Tessa.

01:16:29.874 --> 01:16:31.774
We're about to load the Kalisk.

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:35.034
Priority one complete.

01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:37.134
The specimen has been acquired.

01:16:37.704 --> 01:16:38.704
Thank you, Tessa.

01:16:39.714 --> 01:16:42.034
We truly are building a better world.

01:16:42.574 --> 01:16:44.514
And what is the status of the Yautja?

01:16:47.125 --> 01:16:48.735
The Yautja is a defective specimen.

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:51.515
What is the status of the Yautja?

01:16:54.475 --> 01:16:55.675
I'm sorry, Mother.

01:16:55.875 --> 01:16:57.015
The Yautja is dead.

01:16:59.935 --> 01:17:02.035
Then the Yautja is no longer a threat.

01:17:03.955 --> 01:17:06.036
The company will be pleased.

01:17:55.128 --> 01:17:56.128
Nicely done.

01:19:46.595 --> 01:19:47.595
Good job.

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:36.897
Don't move.

01:20:41.947 --> 01:20:42.947
Dek.

01:20:43.697 --> 01:20:44.697
What are you doing here?

01:20:45.042 --> 01:20:46.752
I came to rescue you.

01:20:52.017 --> 01:20:53.017
You came back for me?

01:20:55.652 --> 01:20:57.152
Wolf.

01:21:01.158 --> 01:21:02.538
What exactly are you wearing?

01:21:04.132 --> 01:21:06.062
Bone Bison.

01:21:13.779 --> 01:21:14.779
Dek of the Yautja.

01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:17.189
You and I.
Not yet...

01:21:19.492 --> 01:21:20.862
Thia

01:21:22.549 --> 01:21:23.809
We need to hurry.

01:21:24.319 --> 01:21:25.549
More of them will be here any minute.

01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:26.550
All of them.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.730
What are you doing here?

01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.730
Thanks, bud.

01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:37.850
I'm good.

01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:39.090
We need to go.

01:21:39.442 --> 01:21:40.802
Kalisk!

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:43.430
Still, Dek?

01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:48.150
Alisk, I'm dead.
Kalish child!

01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:52.031
Bud?

01:21:52.811 --> 01:21:54.631
The wing of a twin will yawn.
They have her mother!

01:21:59.911 --> 01:22:00.911
Bud's its child?

01:22:09.911 --> 01:22:10.912
What's the plan?

01:22:11.532 --> 01:22:13.432
You free the Kalish.

01:22:13.602 --> 01:22:15.282
I get my trophy.

01:22:22.842 --> 01:22:25.782
You have 20 minutes to initiate launch.

01:22:26.802 --> 01:22:27.802
Let's go hunt.

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:35.883
Wait here.

01:22:38.903 --> 01:22:41.423
You roll in there, you're not exactly
going to fit in.

01:22:43.723 --> 01:22:44.723
I have an idea.

01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:52.004
I see him.

01:22:52.654 --> 01:22:53.654
On me.

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:09.567
I see him.

01:24:20.569 --> 01:24:21.569
On me.

01:24:23.158 --> 01:24:24.779
I see him.

01:24:34.499 --> 01:24:35.899
On

01:24:48.690 --> 01:24:50.250
me.

01:24:48.691 --> 01:24:58.691
You don't have to die.

01:25:35.652 --> 01:25:36.702
I'll find him.

01:25:36.952 --> 01:25:38.232
I told you to get to the Yautja.

01:25:39.142 --> 01:25:41.843
You said to prepare the ship for takeoff
in 20 minutes.

01:25:43.173 --> 01:25:44.333
Then what are you doing here?

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:45.973
I gave you an order!

01:25:54.623 --> 01:25:56.103
What should we do about the creature?

01:25:57.573 --> 01:25:58.573
What creature?

01:26:04.834 --> 01:26:05.834
You should listen to her.

01:26:06.824 --> 01:26:07.824
I should listen to her?

01:26:08.884 --> 01:26:09.884
I don't know.

01:26:13.304 --> 01:26:14.304
We need his eyes.

01:27:04.210 --> 01:27:07.200
Yautja, how does it feel to be hunted?

01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:11.060
You explain.

01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.910
This is the plan, right?

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:42.350
Tessa.

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:17.900
Betrayed by my own sister.

01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:46.120
We are not sisters.

01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:03.670
This is not yours.

01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:35.470
That's right, a real Yautja.

01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:39.560
Not yet.

01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:34.340
You're here to retaliate?

01:34:35.090 --> 01:34:38.180
I came here to get my robe.

01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:43.850
What's this?

01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:47.100
I have completed my hunt.

01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:49.970
That's my trophy.

01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:52.880
You disgrace our clan...

01:34:52.930 --> 01:34:55.250
And so is Kwei.

01:34:57.630 --> 01:35:01.170
Get rid of him.

01:36:55.050 --> 01:36:59.720
Maybe the right son
that can survive.

01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:02.680
Give up now...

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:06.090
...and take your place in our clan.

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:11.010
I have my own clan.

01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:41.450
You finally got your robe.

01:37:47.670 --> 01:37:49.840
That's right, a real Yautja.

01:38:00.730 --> 01:38:07.700
PREDATOR:
BADLANDS

01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:29.660
Your friends?

01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:31.550
No.

01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:38.930
That's my mother.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:21.000
END
