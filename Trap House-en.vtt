your character.

Ah... all right. All right.

00:02:18.973 --> 00:02:22.559
Kinda diggin' these wheels
though, right? We could do this.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.896
Get one of these bad boys, drive
across country, me and Cody.

00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:28.982
- Someday, I hope.
- And how's he doin'?

00:02:28.983 --> 00:02:32.026
You know, keep hoping
that time will do its thing,

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:34.779
but he keeps pulling away.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.615
I had to take his car keys
from him this morning.

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:39.743
Did not go well.

00:02:57.428 --> 00:02:59.262
- Idiot!
- Stop!

00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:02.098
Yes, finish strong!

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.684
- I know him.
- I bring you lunch.

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:07.103
- So smooth.
- Thanks.

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:09.981
- Overcompensating?
- Constantly. Just for you.

00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:11.191
- Wow!
- Wow!

00:03:11.317 --> 00:03:12.317
What a mess!

00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:14.694
Er... compliments
of Mama Padilla.

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:15.778
Ah...

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.488
I told her not
to make the heavy stuff

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.740
when you have a meet...

00:03:18.741 --> 00:03:21.075
Just tell her I love them
and thank you very much.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:22.201
- Hey...
- Hi y'all.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.997
Hello, family. Ooh, cupcakes.

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:27.081
What mood was your dad in
this morning?

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:28.917
Shitty. He stole my car keys.

00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:30.877
It's not like
I have another set though.

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:33.463
You just don't learn.
He's gonna kill you, white boy.

00:03:33.464 --> 00:03:35.173
I'll be home before him.

00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:37.717
But he did say
he'd be working late, so...

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:39.218
My mom seems torqued up.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.137
I think something's
going down today.

00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:42.805
My mom said
a little extra prayer.

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:44.307
She always does before a raid.

00:03:44.308 --> 00:03:47.144
Now I'm going to be worried
about this all day.

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:50.146
Guys, they are gonna be fine.

00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:52.232
- Yeah.
- All right, they always are.

- Hey...
- Hey, señor.

00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:25.473
- Hey!
- No gas?

00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:26.600
No gas.

00:04:27.643 --> 00:04:30.478
- Sign says "gas".
- Lo siento, no gas today.

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.273
If you don't have any gas,
your sign should say "no gas".

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:35.817
Try down the road,
we're all out.

00:04:35.818 --> 00:04:38.194
How far down the road?
I gotta use the bathroom.

00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:41.447
- Piss on the road.
- I don't have to piss.

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.825
I've got a turtle that needs
to be released in the wild.

00:04:43.826 --> 00:04:45.743
Know what I mean?

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.287
Hey, cabron.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.206
- Easy.
- Better get back in.

00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:53.167
I just had to use the bathroom.
That's all. Take it easy.

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:57.922
Gotcha. Nice job, Wash.

Ah man,
you put my favourite shirt on.

00:05:11.562 --> 00:05:13.104
Just for you, Padilla.

00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:15.606
- Home in time for dinner, right?
- Hell, yeah!

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:16.983
Hey guys.

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:19.444
Just in case, let's keep
our phones on vibrate, okay?

00:05:19.445 --> 00:05:21.446
- Yeah.
- Sure.

00:05:21.447 --> 00:05:23.448
Hey, have fun in
AP Calculus, nerd.

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.575
- Oh, you know I will.
- Must be nice.

00:05:25.576 --> 00:05:28.369
- Free ride to Princeton.
- Bye.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.625
Hey, you're the new girl, right?

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:37.086
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.

I think you're in my chem class,
we should like, study some time.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.888
I'm actually kind of hoping
to pass that class. But thanks.

00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:51.351
Nice... Strike out!

00:05:51.477 --> 00:05:53.227
It wasn't a strike out
necessarily.

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.688
More like a... scouting report.

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.565
She don't know
what she's missing.

00:05:57.566 --> 00:06:00.485
- I'll go on a date with you.
- All right.

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:08.160
Lower your weapon.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.288
Grenade!

00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:15.459
Move in.

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:49.451
Here!

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.170
- Clear.
- Clear.

00:07:06.844 --> 00:07:08.804
All the way to Mexico,
huh, baby?

00:07:09.513 --> 00:07:11.849
Deep and dirty, like your mom.

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.998
The DEA didn't get lucky.

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:38.292

00:08:00.272 --> 00:08:02.982
Shit, it's wired.
It's wired. Go! Go back. Go!

Shit!

00:08:08.614 --> 00:08:10.991
Move down to the left,
old man!

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:13.451
Go, go, go, go, go.

00:08:13.452 --> 00:08:14.911
Move, move.

00:08:14.912 --> 00:08:16.537
Come on!

00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:21.292
Come on!

00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:35.599
Just move!

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:48.195
Go, go, go.

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:51.989
Everyone out!

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.533
Let's go!

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:56.703
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.748
Aargh!

00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:09.757
Shit, was tighter than a--

00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:27.441
Shoot. Shoot!

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.614
Go! Go! Come on!

00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:36.159
Go!

00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:39.578
Can Jesse Padilla
please come to the office?

00:10:07.316 --> 00:10:09.276
What happened?

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:18.386
I didn't say bye
to him this morning.

00:11:18.387 --> 00:11:19.595
I'm sorry.

00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:22.974
Jesse...

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.019
I don't know what to do.

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.938
Damn it, Cody. Really?
Been texting you for hours.

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.482
What are you talking about?
I told you where I was going.

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:14.817
That's not the point.

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:16.736
This is not the night
to ghost me.

00:12:17.988 --> 00:12:19.989
Jesus Christ, Dad.
Are you okay?

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.824
- Yeah.
- What happened?

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.742
Nothing, I'm fine. Okay?
Except...

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.453
I've been worried sick
about you,

00:12:25.454 --> 00:12:27.163
because you can't bother
to text?

00:12:27.164 --> 00:12:30.291
I was focused on Jesse, okay?
He's a wreck.

00:12:30.292 --> 00:12:32.209
It's just not safe right now.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.712
We can't keep doing this. Okay?

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:37.548
I'm 18 now. You gotta loosen
the leash a little bit.

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:39.216
I just need you
to be more careful.

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:41.677
- If I text, you text me back.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.847
I should have texted you back.

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:47.558
Look...
I know it's gonna be hard,

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:49.561
but I was talking
with the other parents.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.646
We don't think you guys
should hang out for a while.

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:54.148
- Are you serious?
- Just for a while.

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:55.441
We get the drill.

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:57.234
There's other people around,
we don't say anything.

00:12:57.235 --> 00:13:01.238
You know, right now
it's just a risk. Okay?

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.908
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

00:13:03.909 --> 00:13:06.203
Come on.
Let me make something to eat.

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.955
I already ate.

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:19.299
Manny was the best of us.

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:26.181
A man who cared deeply
about his community...

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.143
his friends...

00:13:31.937 --> 00:13:33.687
Most of all, his family.

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.941
A loving husband
to his wife, Lucy.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.985
I'm so proud of his son, Jesse.

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:43.405
He was our North Star

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:45.992
and we always tried
to follow his example.

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:15.854
It seems
that we have a very big problem.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.399
In this house.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:22.946
And it seems
we have an infestation...

00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:29.327
Rats. Rats. Rats.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:37.751
A rat told the DEA

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:39.754
...about our tunnel.

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:42.549
And they stole our cheese.

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:44.968
So where's our cheese, huh?

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:47.637
Where's our cheese?

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:51.349
Vasquez killed a pig for me.

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:54.894
So he's clean.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:57.772
But all you idiots...

00:14:59.274 --> 00:15:01.484
How many rats are there here?

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.573
Who's the rat, cabrones?

00:15:15.332 --> 00:15:17.250
Was it you, my friend?

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:19.501
Are you the rat?

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:22.088
No, boss. No, never.

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.927
Kill him.

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:31.097
I know he's your cousin.

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:34.642
I gave you your first job
together, remember?

00:15:34.643 --> 00:15:36.144
When you were kids.

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:52.576
No, cousin, don't kill me.

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:54.371
Don't kill me.

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:06.341
If we find the rats,
they'll lead us to the pigs!

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:13.472
Rats and pigs, really?

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:15.057
Quite a performance.

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:16.517
You feel better now?

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:19.437
-  He's improved, no?
-  No, he hasn't.

00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:23.899
This is no way to live.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.068
He's survived much worse.

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:27.778
You shouldn't even be here.

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:29.239
Looks like you need the help.

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:31.657
You're helping in El Paso.

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:33.367
You lost an entire tunnel.

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:35.160
Months of work for nothing.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:37.079
What do you think he'd do?

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.415
Flush out the rats.
Like I'm doing.

00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:41.626
Papito operated like a shadow.

00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:45.380
The work
you're doing there is vital.

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:47.882
I can only trust you.

00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:58.517
Let's get started. We are
having a lab session today.

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:02.439
So everyone, please find
a partner. Don't be shy.

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:07.484
-  Me?
- Mm-hm.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.988
When I was little, I used
to blow shit up all the time.

00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:12.656
I'm not sure
that's the assignment.

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.491
The 13 x 100, the smaller one.

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:17.578
Oh, you actually know this?
That wasn't a bullshit?

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.997
That was mostly bullshit,
but like I said,

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:22.875
when I was younger,
I was like a mad scientist.

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:24.753
- I was a real punk.
- Was?!

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:28.172
How do you like El Paso so far?
Pretty cool, right?

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:30.883
- Please tell me you're kidding.
- Of course.

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:33.218
I am trying to like it.
I mean, I kind of have to.

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:35.512
It's not like we can move back.

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:37.347
I had a whole life
in San Antonio.

00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:39.641
All my friends are there.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:41.727
But now I have to start over.

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:44.188
That's gotta be tough.
I'm sorry.

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:45.940
Thanks.

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:48.610
At least I have a lab partner.

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.820
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:54.156
- Cheers!
- Ready?

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:55.658
Yep.

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:58.911
Whoa! Jeez!

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:00.997
Boom... science.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.364
He's clean.

00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:47.293
Hi, I'm here
to collect the order. Thanks.

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.758
Benito knows it's me.

00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:56.761
If he knew it was you,
you wouldn't be here.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:00.264
I can't do this.
I can't help you anymore.

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:02.141
I'm out. I'm sorry.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:03.642
Then you're out.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:05.769
That was the deal.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.564
Just give me a few days
to work out witness protection.

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:10.774
- Thank you.
- Any word on the new tunnel?

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.235
Not yet.

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:14.778
I heard Benito's sister
lives in El Paso.

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:18.115
- I didn't know he had a sister.
- I think her name's Natalia.

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:20.117
I bet she's here
under a fake name.

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.619
- You know what she's doing here?
- Don't know.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.331
Everything about her,
they keep real quiet.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:29.167
- Appreciate it, thanks.
- Thanks.

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:49.856
Come on, gentlemen!

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:56.778
Hey, what's going on?

00:19:56.779 --> 00:19:59.698
We're not supposed to hang out.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:02.784
Er, I am moving
and I have to transfer schools.

00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:05.162
What? Like moving away?

00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:07.623
We're moving in
with my mum's sister in Abilene,

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:09.000
eight hours away.

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:11.543
It's either that or Spain.
I have grandparents there.

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:12.628
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

00:20:12.629 --> 00:20:15.297
The DEA's death benefits
are, um, shit,

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:17.633
as it turns out,
and with my dad not here,

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.384
we can't afford
to stay in the house.

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:22.387
Mom's medical
is gonna run out soon.

00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:24.473
I don't think I can talk
about that right now.

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:28.227
- It's okay.
- Hey, come here. It's okay.

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:43.408
...the news
from El Paso and Juárez.

00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:52.584
Did you hear Jesse and
his mom are having to move away?

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:55.921
Yeah, I heard.
We'll visit. Roadtrip.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:58.465
Isn't there anything
the DEA can do to help them?

00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:00.550
What about all that cash
you seized in the raid?

00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:02.636
It goes
into our operating budget.

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:04.471
That's how we keep pace
with the cartels.

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:06.556
But Jesse's dad died
getting that money.

00:21:06.557 --> 00:21:09.476
Doesn't the DEA
owe the family something?

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:13.271
Yeah, I hear you, bud,
but it's not the way it works.

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:16.817
We're setting up a GoFundMe
for them. We'll do what we can.

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:18.903
So if you die, I get a GoFundMe?

00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:37.422
- To Manny.
- Manny.

00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:45.095
I always wished
I could be more like Manny.

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:48.181
Really?
He wanted to be like you.

00:21:48.182 --> 00:21:50.059
- No.
- Yeah.

00:21:50.852 --> 00:21:55.397
I don't mean about the job.
Manny was such a great father.

00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:58.525
Hey, man. You're a great father.

00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:01.654
No, Wendy was the one who
knew how to be there for Cody.

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:04.407
Even after she got sick,

00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:09.871
she held us together...
right up till the end.

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:13.166
And now...

00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:15.917
Yeah.

00:22:15.918 --> 00:22:19.130
I don't know shit, right?
I mean, I don't have kids...

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:25.260
Lizzy's been bringing Deni
on the training exercises.

00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:28.890
Yeah, yeah...
She wants Deni to join up.

00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:32.225
I don't want Cody
anywhere near this job.

00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:34.978
Way too cowboy, that kid.
He'll get himself killed.

00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:36.813
I know, I hear that, but...

00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:41.151
It looks like she's trying to
spend some time with her, right?

00:22:41.152 --> 00:22:43.488
No pressure, no agenda.

00:22:44.822 --> 00:22:46.949
Things open up.

00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:51.703
Wrist control. Grab the wrist.

00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:54.372
If they're backing away
from you, go double wrist.

00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:57.000
Put your weight on them.
Trip them.

00:22:57.001 --> 00:22:58.668
There it is.

00:22:58.669 --> 00:23:01.922
Another way,
same wrist control, underhook.

00:23:01.923 --> 00:23:04.549
Scoot under and drag 'em back.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.967
There it is.

00:23:05.968 --> 00:23:07.594
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:09.304
- Cody wrestles, right?
- Yeah.

00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:12.307
You want to get him out here.
Throw him around a bit.

00:23:12.308 --> 00:23:14.810
- I just want him watching today.
- All right.

00:23:14.811 --> 00:23:17.395
Come on, guys.
Let's get on these bags.

00:23:21.526 --> 00:23:24.987
♪ Whatever happened
to the plans we made ♪

00:23:25.113 --> 00:23:28.574
♪ Laying awake after midnight ♪

00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:32.077
♪ Oh, I don't want
to lose that flame...

00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:36.581
Hey. Cody's with me.

00:23:36.582 --> 00:23:39.626
-  Cody, what's the word?
- Hey Wash. I'm good.

00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:42.295
Ray, I just rolled up on
a trap house on the south side.

00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:44.381
- Wanna check it out?
- Is it locked down?

00:23:44.382 --> 00:23:46.967
Cops have been here for hours.
Nothing to worry about.

00:23:46.968 --> 00:23:50.304
What do you say?
Want to see a trap house?

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.265
Yeah, that'll be cool.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:00.940
♪ The years go by and somehow
I just can't forget...

00:24:03.568 --> 00:24:05.570
There it is.

00:24:09.198 --> 00:24:10.867
All right...

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.994
- How's it going, Cody?
- Hey. All right.

00:24:13.995 --> 00:24:15.287
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:24:15.288 --> 00:24:17.372
- How did they bust it?
- It was a tough case.

00:24:17.373 --> 00:24:19.166
Tweaker passed out
on the sidewalk.

00:24:19.167 --> 00:24:20.667
Nobody bothered to bring him in.

00:24:20.668 --> 00:24:22.377
A black-and-white
was just rolling by.

00:24:23.296 --> 00:24:25.463
- Good help's hard to find.
- Yeah.

00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:28.092
Welcome to the glamorous life
of dealing drugs.

00:24:29.218 --> 00:24:31.845
- I'd say don't touch anything...
- Yeah, no danger of that.

00:24:31.846 --> 00:24:33.346
- Anybody talking?
- Nah.

00:24:33.347 --> 00:24:35.640
Good soldiers,
nothing on the wiretaps either

00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:38.727
but I think there must be
a distribution hub nearby.

00:24:38.728 --> 00:24:40.729
Yeah, that'll make sense.

00:25:03.336 --> 00:25:05.546
- Wash... Reynolds.
- Yeah.

00:25:28.986 --> 00:25:30.112
His sister, Natalia.

00:25:30.238 --> 00:25:33.406
PFM has heard the rumour too,
but they got nothing on her.

00:25:33.407 --> 00:25:35.659
No files, no photos. Nothing.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.245
Her father could've wiped
her records decades ago.

00:25:38.246 --> 00:25:40.915
It's gotta be how
she's getting back and forth.

00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:50.674
If she is in El Paso,
she probably has a US passport,

00:25:50.675 --> 00:25:52.467
solid identity, all backstopped.

00:25:52.468 --> 00:25:53.927
So we're not gonna find her.

00:25:53.928 --> 00:25:55.638
Not unless she wants us to.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.182
All right. Let's go.

00:26:08.693 --> 00:26:10.694
Cody, a couple more minutes
and we're out of here.

00:26:10.695 --> 00:26:12.488
It's all good.

00:26:18.703 --> 00:26:21.204
Let's clarify the crazy
coming out of your mouth.

00:26:21.205 --> 00:26:22.914
You want us
to jack a drug cartel?

00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:25.208
No. A trap house
owned by a cartel.

00:26:25.209 --> 00:26:26.918
I was just
at one of these places.

00:26:26.919 --> 00:26:28.795
I'm telling you,
it's amateur hour.

00:26:28.796 --> 00:26:31.464
One lookout, one dealer,
bottom of the barrel dumbasses.

00:26:31.465 --> 00:26:34.050
A couple of junkies sleeping
in the corner. That's it.

00:26:34.051 --> 00:26:35.969
Maybe with the money
that we steal from him,

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.721
Jesse and his mom
can buy a house,

00:26:37.722 --> 00:26:40.140
- pay off her medical bill.
- Jesse can go to college.

00:26:40.141 --> 00:26:41.850
I just want to know
what my job is.

00:26:41.851 --> 00:26:43.935
Kyle, you would have
a really important job.

00:26:43.936 --> 00:26:45.687
- Lay it on me.
- The lookout.

00:26:45.688 --> 00:26:48.023
Okay, I'm the lookout.

00:26:48.024 --> 00:26:51.109
Are we doing this for real
or are we just bullshitting?

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.321
Deni, I don't love
how quiet you're being.

00:26:53.446 --> 00:26:56.197
I'm thinking about it.

00:26:56.198 --> 00:26:57.907
Between us,
we got it all covered.

00:26:57.908 --> 00:26:59.659
I'd be the getaway driver.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.537
And Deni, your mom takes you
to training exercises.

00:27:02.538 --> 00:27:04.372
So you know the basics.

00:27:04.373 --> 00:27:07.292
Even better, you know
where all the DEA offsites are.

00:27:07.293 --> 00:27:09.210
- So...
- You borrow your mum's keys

00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:10.837
and then boom,
we have access

00:27:10.838 --> 00:27:12.547
to top of the line
DEA equipment.

00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:15.508
All compliance gear only,
non-lethal, no one gets hurt.

00:27:15.509 --> 00:27:18.345
Look, even if we could rob
a trap house, then what?

00:27:18.346 --> 00:27:21.181
We can't just FedEx Jesse
a box full of drug money.

00:27:21.182 --> 00:27:23.016
You have to set up
offshore shell companies

00:27:23.017 --> 00:27:24.351
with a pristine laptop

00:27:24.352 --> 00:27:27.437
and open a ton of bank accounts,
but only with small deposits

00:27:27.438 --> 00:27:30.190
to make sure you stay under
the IRS reporting requirements.

00:27:30.191 --> 00:27:32.192
Your dad worked
money laundering, right?

00:27:32.193 --> 00:27:34.277
- Ah, shit.
- So we're covered.

00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:36.489
Is this gonna be like
the outdoor survival club

00:27:36.614 --> 00:27:37.989
you tried to start?

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.575
I'm being serious. These
assholes killed Jesse's dad.

00:27:40.576 --> 00:27:42.577
If one of our parents got killed

00:27:42.578 --> 00:27:44.746
and we asked Jesse
to help us out, he'd say yes.

00:27:44.747 --> 00:27:46.247
You know he would.

00:27:46.248 --> 00:27:47.999
I'm not saying let's do it,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.752
but it does sound
pretty righteous.

00:27:50.753 --> 00:27:53.129
Doing this would be a huge risk,
for sure.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.465
We've all been saying that
we want to help Jesse, right?

00:27:55.466 --> 00:27:58.259
So this is how.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.472
The DEA should be taking care
of them and they're not.

00:28:02.765 --> 00:28:08.270
So we will. We can do this,
but it has to be all of us.

00:28:33.003 --> 00:28:34.588
He's clear.

00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:49.395
Hi. I'm here for the order.

00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:54.191
You're all set. So walk away,
enjoy your new life.

00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:56.861
Thank you.

00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:00.989
A vehicle on the shoulder.

00:29:04.493 --> 00:29:06.161
Gun!

00:29:07.288 --> 00:29:09.748
Everyone on the floor.
Down on the floor, flat!

00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:11.624
Shit!

00:29:17.465 --> 00:29:18.799
Hit the pedal!

00:29:25.139 --> 00:29:27.641
Get down! Get down!!

00:29:30.227 --> 00:29:33.021
Ray! Ray, Ray, Ray,
come on. That's it.

00:29:33.022 --> 00:29:34.690
Get down.

00:29:51.999 --> 00:29:55.919
Hey, look at you,
buddy. You're a lucky man.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.879
You're lucky, hombre.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.924
Looks pretty good on you.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.971
Natalia Cabrera,
tell us about her.

00:30:09.642 --> 00:30:13.978
Okay, we get it. A lot of people
don't like talking to us.

00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:16.064
They've got families
they want to protect.

00:30:16.065 --> 00:30:18.817
You don't have any family.

00:30:18.943 --> 00:30:21.195
You were recruited
out of the orphanage.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.072
You got options.

00:30:24.573 --> 00:30:27.493
You killed a DEA agent in Texas.

00:30:28.285 --> 00:30:30.119
Even if
we can't make that stick,

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.913
we got you on the informant.

00:30:31.914 --> 00:30:33.998
People are gonna be lining up
to get on the jury

00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:35.875
to put you in the chair.

00:30:35.876 --> 00:30:38.671
The only way you survive this
is by talking to us.

00:30:40.297 --> 00:30:43.216
Natalia Cabrera.
We know she's in El Paso.

00:30:43.217 --> 00:30:45.010
What's she doing here?

00:30:47.429 --> 00:30:53.185
Well, shit, I'll tell you,
cerdos, free of charge.

00:30:54.562 --> 00:30:57.940
Natalia Cabrera
is in El Paso for you.

00:30:59.066 --> 00:31:00.859
She's here
to crack the cover identities

00:31:00.985 --> 00:31:02.403
of all you DEA agents.

00:31:03.654 --> 00:31:07.991
She's digging.
She's spreading money around.

00:31:07.992 --> 00:31:11.995
They're gonna find you
and wipe you out

00:31:11.996 --> 00:31:13.789
and all of your families.

00:31:32.308 --> 00:31:34.225
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, kid.

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:36.352
Look, something came up.
I'm gonna be at work late.

00:31:36.353 --> 00:31:39.230
- Okay, cool. Good to know.
- Did you have a good day?

00:31:39.231 --> 00:31:42.109
Ah, it's been fine.
Nothing special.

00:31:43.235 --> 00:31:44.777
- Don't stay out too late.
- Okay.

00:31:44.778 --> 00:31:47.155
- We still need to be careful.
- Okay, cool.

00:31:47.156 --> 00:31:49.241
- Bye.
- See ya. Bye.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.170
Jesus, he's gotta take
a leak sometime.

00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:04.297
Why'd you say that?
Now I have to take a leak.

00:32:04.298 --> 00:32:05.798
- Me too.
- Me three.

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:07.300
You all got bladder problems.

00:32:07.301 --> 00:32:09.010
How long do you guys
want to wait?

00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:10.678
I have an essay
due first period.

00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:12.931
You should do your homework
early on crime night.

00:32:13.057 --> 00:32:16.352
- Not getting cold feet, Yvonne?
- Absolutely.

00:32:17.311 --> 00:32:20.188
Again, this will
fire a cartridge.

00:32:20.189 --> 00:32:23.524
If you miss,
this end still works as a taser.

00:32:23.525 --> 00:32:25.944
- I got it, I got it.
- What is your job?

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:27.195
I sit in the car like a loser

00:32:27.196 --> 00:32:29.238
while you guys
do all the cool shit.

00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:31.324
If things get messed up,
I call 911.

00:32:31.325 --> 00:32:34.160
I don't wanna go to jail
'cause you lost your shit.

00:32:34.161 --> 00:32:37.330
I don't lose my shit.
I'm ice cold.

00:32:37.331 --> 00:32:38.915
We can't go to jail.
We're still minors.

00:32:38.916 --> 00:32:40.708
Yeah, but I'm not.

00:32:40.709 --> 00:32:44.462
Worst case, us three will do
a little time in juvey.

00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:46.214
When we turn 18,
it all goes away.

00:32:46.215 --> 00:32:48.675
Cody will take the fall.
It was his idea.

00:32:48.676 --> 00:32:49.676
Thanks.

00:32:49.677 --> 00:32:53.097
Guys, we don't have guns
but they probably definitely do.

00:32:54.264 --> 00:32:56.809
Maybe I should wear
a flak jacket too?

00:33:00.396 --> 00:33:03.315
Hey, we're on. We're doing this?

00:33:05.234 --> 00:33:07.318
- Shit.
- Yes.

00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:08.654
- Yes.
- Shit.

00:33:09.405 --> 00:33:11.531
- Have fun without me.
- You want to trade?

00:33:11.532 --> 00:33:13.116
- No, bye. Get out.
- You want go?

00:33:13.117 --> 00:33:14.701
Okay.

00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:22.167
- For Jesse.
- Yeah, for Jesse.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.013
Okay, same plan. Zerg rush,
knock over the candle,

00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:38.016
take the cash, out.

00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:29.526
-  What do we do?
- Don't know.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.572
That way. Go.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.005
Shit.

00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:58.722
Oh, shit.

00:35:00.474 --> 00:35:01.975
Oh, Jesus.

00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:07.730
I can't see! I can't see!

00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:10.024
- Okay. Get the money!
-  Let's go.

00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:11.442
What's going on?

00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:13.445
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

00:35:14.029 --> 00:35:16.740
It's Cabrera's money!
You're making a big mistake!

00:35:18.867 --> 00:35:20.285
-  Go!
-  Follow me.

00:35:26.792 --> 00:35:28.376
Oh, shit.

00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:33.631
Shit!

00:35:41.807 --> 00:35:43.558
Cody, clear!

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.524
- It's us!
- I knew you'd be okay.

00:35:51.525 --> 00:35:53.484
- I didn't call the cops!
- Good job!

00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:55.653
- Oh my God, that was insane!
- Shit.

00:35:55.654 --> 00:35:57.864
You guys okay?
Let's go!

00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:14.547
- How are the eyes?
- Better. Coming back.

00:36:14.548 --> 00:36:17.008
We have a grand total.
Wanna hear it?

00:36:17.009 --> 00:36:21.262
- Yeah.
- All in, we have $497.

00:36:21.263 --> 00:36:23.055
- Huh...
- Mm-hm.

00:36:24.975 --> 00:36:26.976
Oh my God.

00:36:26.977 --> 00:36:30.062
I don't think we're sending
Jesse to Yale with that.

00:36:30.063 --> 00:36:32.106
We're the biggest morons
on the planet.

00:36:32.107 --> 00:36:34.942
We almost got ourselves killed
for not even 500 bucks.

00:36:34.943 --> 00:36:37.279
Our obituaries would be so sad.

00:36:37.404 --> 00:36:40.782
"Local teens executed. Should
have got an after-school job."

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:44.911
- You know what? I'm proud of us.
- Really?

00:36:44.912 --> 00:36:46.078
- For real.
- Yeah?

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:48.331
We did the thing
and when it all went to shit,

00:36:48.332 --> 00:36:50.124
nobody panicked,
we stuck together

00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:51.542
and helped each other out.

00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:54.086
- That was a goddamn rush.
- Hell, yeah.

00:36:56.673 --> 00:37:00.427
Calm down.
There's no reason to panic.

00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:07.809
Vasquez will keep his mouth
shut. He'll do time. Besides...

00:37:08.644 --> 00:37:10.228
It was just a trap house.

00:37:10.354 --> 00:37:11.979
There was barely any money.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.481
It's not about the money.

00:37:13.482 --> 00:37:14.982
This makes us look weak!

00:37:14.983 --> 00:37:17.360
First the tunnel, then this!

00:37:17.361 --> 00:37:19.111
Open season on us.

00:37:19.112 --> 00:37:21.280
We cannot flinch.

00:37:21.281 --> 00:37:24.700
This happened
in your city, didn't it?

00:37:24.701 --> 00:37:27.870
Find out who it was
and make an example out of 'em?

00:37:30.123 --> 00:37:33.459
The squatter said the trap house
got knocked over last night.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.005
That was just a smash and grab.
These bodies happened later.

00:37:38.632 --> 00:37:41.176
Yeah,
Benito's not the forgiving type.

00:37:41.718 --> 00:37:43.762
We found a helmet
with night vision.

00:37:44.554 --> 00:37:47.056
These bastards aren't civilians.

00:37:47.057 --> 00:37:49.392
Military grade. Very strange.

00:37:49.393 --> 00:37:52.770
No, it's not
strange. It was the DEA.

00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:54.397
They're going rogue.

00:37:54.398 --> 00:37:56.399
They lost their informant,
their friend,

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.861
and they're out for revenge,
that's it.

00:37:59.987 --> 00:38:02.114
Who'd be dumb enough
to steal from them anyway?

00:38:02.239 --> 00:38:03.906
I doubt they know
who it belonged to.

00:38:03.907 --> 00:38:07.619
- Was probably just a one-off.
- I hope so. For their sake.

00:38:14.001 --> 00:38:16.627
- Ow! My tongue.
- Let me get that.

00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:19.631
Oh! No, it's fine. I got it.

00:38:21.008 --> 00:38:23.050
To be honest,
I'm a little nervous.

00:38:23.051 --> 00:38:25.469
Oh, I... I was nervous
because I thought you weren't.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.305
- So...
- Oh, yeah.

00:38:28.515 --> 00:38:29.725
...

00:38:30.934 --> 00:38:33.436
Sorry,
this crazy woman's my mom.

00:38:33.437 --> 00:38:35.855
Oh no, I... trust me,
I get that.

00:38:35.856 --> 00:38:38.900
- Yeah, your mom too?
- Uh, no, my dad.

00:38:39.568 --> 00:38:41.319
My mom passed away
actually, so...

00:38:42.404 --> 00:38:44.905
- God, I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, no. I appreciate it.

00:38:44.906 --> 00:38:47.951
It was three years ago.
Leukaemia, so...

00:38:49.119 --> 00:38:51.537
What about you and your folks?
Still together or...?

00:38:51.538 --> 00:38:53.998
Divorced. Dad's somewhere.

00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:57.169
He had a kid and decided,
it's not really my thing.

00:38:58.628 --> 00:39:01.715
Ask me, an overprotective father
kind of sounds nice.

00:39:02.716 --> 00:39:04.967
So, what's his deal?

00:39:04.968 --> 00:39:07.345
He's always been about his job.

00:39:07.471 --> 00:39:09.597
He's in construction,
project manager.

00:39:09.598 --> 00:39:12.141
But now that it's just him,
he's gotta be the parent.

00:39:12.142 --> 00:39:15.352
Like, who's gonna
keep me alive anyway.

00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:17.480
Sorry? Keep you alive?!

00:39:17.481 --> 00:39:18.564
What are you doing
on the weekends?

00:39:18.565 --> 00:39:21.650
Like he owes that to my mom.

00:39:21.651 --> 00:39:23.819
It's just another job
he's gotta do.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.489
Sounds like
we have awesome families.

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.908
Maybe that's why
we're good lab partners.

00:39:28.909 --> 00:39:30.869
I'm gonna give myself a mission.

00:39:31.495 --> 00:39:33.997
I'm gonna make you happy
you moved here.

00:39:34.122 --> 00:39:35.915
I'm gonna make you
love El Paso.

00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:38.209
- Yeah.
- Boy likes a challenge.

00:39:54.184 --> 00:39:56.310
Yeah, no, we're just...
We're getting filled in.

00:39:56.311 --> 00:39:59.396
- How is your mom doing, Jesse?
- Uh, she's all right.

00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:01.482
Um, she's just,
you know, job hunting,

00:40:01.483 --> 00:40:03.193
which has been
kind of difficult...

00:40:04.277 --> 00:40:07.696
Jesus! All right, would you
piss ants please shut up.

00:40:07.697 --> 00:40:10.616
Hey, I'm on the phone! Stop it!

00:40:10.617 --> 00:40:12.785
I'm gonna step outside
and deal with that.

00:40:12.786 --> 00:40:14.787
- Can I call you guys back?
- Yeah, of course!

00:40:14.788 --> 00:40:15.997
Thank you!

00:40:16.832 --> 00:40:18.374
I'm never having kids.

00:40:18.375 --> 00:40:20.252
Poor Jesse.

00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:34.348
We didn't get what
we need from the trap house.

00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:36.142
That's fine. Rookie mistake.
Won't happen again.

00:40:36.143 --> 00:40:38.686
Right, because we're not robbing
any more trap houses.

00:40:38.687 --> 00:40:41.147
Next we're gonna be hitting
one of Cabrera's money mules.

00:40:41.148 --> 00:40:43.607
- So what now?
- The mule that collects cash

00:40:43.608 --> 00:40:45.693
from the dealers. Spreads it
around cash businesses

00:40:45.694 --> 00:40:47.154
controlled by the cartels
to clean it.

00:40:47.279 --> 00:40:48.195
- I love it.
- Yeah.

00:40:48.196 --> 00:40:50.072
- Cody!
- I'm serious.

00:40:50.073 --> 00:40:54.243
This is our mule. They call him
El Viejo Malhumorado.

00:40:54.244 --> 00:40:56.829
-  Grumpy old man.
- He looks like a hobo.

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.873
- Hm.
- He's kind of hot.

00:40:58.874 --> 00:41:00.791
The idea is
to keep a low profile.

00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:03.335
Every week he does
the same circuit around El Paso.

00:41:03.336 --> 00:41:05.129
Laundromats, pawn shops, bars.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:07.506
His van has to be filled
with cash.

00:41:07.507 --> 00:41:11.260
- What's filled?
- Half a million. At least.

00:41:11.261 --> 00:41:13.846
That's Jesse and his mom
well taken care of.

00:41:13.847 --> 00:41:16.308
So, what do we think?

00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:21.604
- I'm in...
-  Yes.

00:41:21.605 --> 00:41:25.399
If we don't pull
the entire thing out of our ass.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.861
This time
we actually have a plan.

00:41:27.986 --> 00:41:29.820
El Viejo does
the same route every week?

00:41:29.821 --> 00:41:31.655
-  Yep.
-  Great.

00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:34.158
Then we have time
to really think this through.

00:41:34.159 --> 00:41:36.869
If we do it smart this time,
then I'm in too.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.997
- Then smart it is.
- Letting y'all know I'm also in.

00:41:39.998 --> 00:41:40.998
Obviously.

00:41:42.876 --> 00:41:44.543
So, where do we start?

00:41:44.544 --> 00:41:47.546
I know where our parents
would start. Recon.

00:41:47.547 --> 00:41:49.257
A shit ton of recon.

00:41:56.014 --> 00:41:58.224
El Viejo is always
followed by two armed guards

00:41:58.225 --> 00:42:00.351
in a sedan.

00:42:00.352 --> 00:42:02.436
No way we just walk up
and taser those guys.

00:42:02.437 --> 00:42:05.731
You're right. For them
we need some heavy artillery.

00:42:05.732 --> 00:42:08.275
- Beanbag shotguns.
- They're non-lethal.

00:42:08.276 --> 00:42:09.986
They just knock you
down for a while.

00:42:10.111 --> 00:42:12.821
Beanbag shotguns.
I could handle one of those.

00:42:12.822 --> 00:42:15.658
Kyle, I don't know. Deni and I
grew up hunting. You didn't.

00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:19.329
I always beat your ass
at Fortnite. So I'm the master.

00:42:20.205 --> 00:42:22.998
If they're up on it, why doesn't
the DEA just shut him down?

00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:24.917
He's not the prize for them.

00:42:24.918 --> 00:42:26.293
They're just
gathering intel for now.

00:42:26.294 --> 00:42:29.005
They put a GPS
on his van, see where he goes,

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:31.340
- who he talks to.
-  So we do the same.

00:42:31.341 --> 00:42:33.717
We'll make sure
our parents aren't following.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.555
♪ ...an evacuation zone and
I think I need to operate now ♪

00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:41.308
♪ And if all goes well
I'll return to the world...

00:42:45.814 --> 00:42:46.981
This is where we do it.

00:42:46.982 --> 00:42:48.482
The neighbourhood
should be empty

00:42:48.483 --> 00:42:50.025
so there should be no traffic.

00:42:50.026 --> 00:42:51.694
It'll be easy
to get in and out of there fast.

00:42:51.695 --> 00:42:53.362
What about the customers?

00:42:53.363 --> 00:42:56.448
We don't want anyone
to see what's happening.

00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:59.201
- Kyle, that's your job.
- Kyle gets a job?

00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:02.080
- I'm a part of this!
- Yeah, he's a part of this.

00:43:08.003 --> 00:43:10.005
On the day, let's leave
our phones at school.

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:11.922
Keep our location history clean.

00:43:11.923 --> 00:43:14.383
When we get El Viejo's van,
where the hell do we put it?

00:43:14.384 --> 00:43:16.176
My grandpa's place.
It's out of town.

00:43:16.177 --> 00:43:18.763
There's an old barn.
It's perfect.

00:44:03.767 --> 00:44:05.393
Let's go!

00:44:31.586 --> 00:44:34.505
-  Let her go!
-  I said drop it!

00:44:34.506 --> 00:44:36.216
Okay.

00:44:38.968 --> 00:44:41.428
Shit. No, no, no.

00:44:41.429 --> 00:44:43.181
Come on, come on, come on.

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.912
Shit.

00:45:06.913 --> 00:45:08.747
I got the keys!

00:45:08.748 --> 00:45:10.917
I got her! Take this.

00:45:14.754 --> 00:45:17.507
-  Come on. Let's go.
-  Let's get out of here!

00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:23.138
-  Fuck you!
-  Yoo-hoo.

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:29.059
Suck on my bag, biatch!
Fortnite, I told you!

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.979
Yeah, nice one!

00:45:35.191 --> 00:45:37.235
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go, go!

00:45:38.486 --> 00:45:40.155
Oh, good job, Kyle.

00:45:48.913 --> 00:45:52.332
Holy shit! Did you see
that? Is your head okay, Deni?

00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:54.251
Yeah. Are you okay?

00:45:54.252 --> 00:45:56.921
Yeah, he's much better looking
in person.

00:46:01.217 --> 00:46:02.760
- Bingo!
- Whoa!

00:46:02.886 --> 00:46:05.138
He's still on us!
This isn't over yet!

00:46:15.148 --> 00:46:17.149
If this ends in a police chase,
we're screwed,

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.068
so keep your masks on!

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.327
Doors!

00:46:29.621 --> 00:46:33.541
Move, I got this.
I got you all back!

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:38.253
-  Shit! Sorry!
-  It's okay! Doors open!

00:46:38.254 --> 00:46:39.506
Now!

00:46:49.224 --> 00:46:53.101
I've got you,
you old son of a bitch.

00:46:53.102 --> 00:46:55.479

Woo!

00:46:58.733 --> 00:47:01.986
Oh my God! That was insane.

00:47:04.197 --> 00:47:07.407

Hey, hey El Viejo. We got him.

00:47:40.066 --> 00:47:42.359
Yeah? Please tell me
his head's still attached.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.610
We caught a break this time.

00:47:43.611 --> 00:47:45.279
He just walked
into a field office.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.530
Smart man.

00:47:46.531 --> 00:47:48.615
He knows Benito's gonna kill him
for losing that shipment.

00:47:48.616 --> 00:47:50.701
- He want witness protection?
- What do you think?

00:47:50.702 --> 00:47:52.160
I'll see what he's got.

00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:55.455
-  So it was a crew?
- Yes, there were four of them.

00:47:55.456 --> 00:47:58.375
- Two women and two men.
- You get a look at them?

00:47:58.376 --> 00:48:01.003
No, they used tear gas on us.

00:48:01.004 --> 00:48:03.797
They all had gas masks on.
I couldn't see.

00:48:03.798 --> 00:48:06.258
- Cartel?
- Oh, God. No. God, no.

00:48:06.259 --> 00:48:08.510
I wouldn't be here
if it was them.

00:48:08.511 --> 00:48:11.430
This was sloppy, not pros.

00:48:11.431 --> 00:48:15.517
You could tell there was...
They did get to jump on us.

00:48:15.518 --> 00:48:19.605
But the two guards with me,
I can tell you all about them.

00:48:19.606 --> 00:48:22.692
Oh, come on. Those guys
are long gone, you know that.

00:48:23.568 --> 00:48:25.485
Come on, give us something
that goes up the chain.

00:48:25.486 --> 00:48:27.447
I... I handled my end only--

00:48:27.572 --> 00:48:30.240
What do you know
about Natalia Cabrera?

00:48:30.241 --> 00:48:33.369
- Well, I've heard the name.
- Any idea what she looks like?

00:48:35.455 --> 00:48:36.913
- No, I--.
- Come on, brother.

00:48:36.914 --> 00:48:39.541
You want WITSEC, you're gonna
have to do better than that.

00:48:39.542 --> 00:48:43.837
I can't give you Benito
and his top guys, all right?

00:48:43.838 --> 00:48:47.175
I can tell you more about
how they move things around.

00:48:48.593 --> 00:48:52.764
I can tell you about the beer
truck. That's something.

00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:55.307
Who the hell is doing this?!

00:48:55.308 --> 00:48:57.392
How come you haven't found them?
Tell me!

00:48:57.393 --> 00:48:59.311
Our whole network is burnt.

00:48:59.312 --> 00:49:02.397
 I have to start
everything from scratch.

00:49:02.398 --> 00:49:03.940
I'll find them!

00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:06.653
It's the DEA pigs.

00:49:06.778 --> 00:49:09.197
They're making fun of us!

00:49:10.698 --> 00:49:15.911
I'm sure they're laughing at us.
I'm sure it's them!

00:49:15.912 --> 00:49:17.537
The DEA
doesn't operate that way.

00:49:17.538 --> 00:49:19.247
Oh yeah? Then what?!

00:49:19.248 --> 00:49:21.500
- Don't be paranoid.
- I want...

00:49:21.501 --> 00:49:24.878
I want the DEA names,
you have to prove it to me.

00:49:24.879 --> 00:49:27.839
I want their names.
I want their faces.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.050
I want their addresses.
I want them dead...

00:49:30.051 --> 00:49:33.887
I want their wives
and kids dead. Their pets too!

00:49:33.888 --> 00:49:34.972
Set a trap!

00:49:38.851 --> 00:49:40.686
- Teresa.
- I've got to get to class.

00:49:40.687 --> 00:49:42.771
I'm sorry
I haven't been around, for real.

00:49:42.772 --> 00:49:44.523
It's just wrestling
has been insane.

00:49:44.524 --> 00:49:46.233
It's fine,
I just don't need this.

00:49:46.234 --> 00:49:50.112
I want to make it up to you.
So how about go hiking with me.

00:49:50.113 --> 00:49:52.490
I know a great spot,
it'll be epic.

00:49:53.908 --> 00:49:55.993
- I don't know.
- Look, if you don't go then...

00:49:56.119 --> 00:49:59.664
I'll be too devastated to study,
and then we'll both fail chem.

00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:04.626
- This is extortion.
- It's actually blackmail.

00:50:04.627 --> 00:50:06.129
Okay.

00:50:20.435 --> 00:50:22.311
- Wow!
- Yeah, I know.

00:50:23.521 --> 00:50:27.607
My mom used to take me here.
She loved the mountains.

00:50:27.608 --> 00:50:29.443
What was she like?

00:50:29.444 --> 00:50:31.486
She was really gentle.

00:50:31.487 --> 00:50:33.739
She'd always joke

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.323
that she couldn't wait
to become a little old lady.

00:50:35.324 --> 00:50:37.617
She still had
the whole mama bear thing going,

00:50:37.618 --> 00:50:39.411
so you wouldn't want
to mess with her.

00:50:39.412 --> 00:50:42.914
Was it a good marriage?
Were they at least happy?

00:50:42.915 --> 00:50:47.461
Yeah, they were.
I couldn't tell you how though,

00:50:47.462 --> 00:50:53.009
because my dad is so massively
closed off and she was so there.

00:50:56.721 --> 00:50:58.263

Second time
the Cabreras have been hit.

00:52:10.795 --> 00:52:12.712
- No way this is random.
- I'm with Ellie.

00:52:12.713 --> 00:52:14.840
This could be a rival cartel.
We took out the tunnel.

00:52:14.841 --> 00:52:16.925
Cabrera's are vulnerable.
Somebody's making a move.

00:52:16.926 --> 00:52:18.426
Really think this is cartel?

00:52:18.427 --> 00:52:20.136
I'd expect it
to be a lot bloodier.

00:52:20.137 --> 00:52:21.680
We're not hearing anything
on the wiretaps

00:52:21.681 --> 00:52:24.724
- about another cartel.
- Maybe it's an inside job.

00:52:24.725 --> 00:52:26.643
Some mid-level players
see things go wobbly,

00:52:26.644 --> 00:52:28.562
decide they're gonna grab
some for themselves.

00:52:28.563 --> 00:52:30.730
Same problem. Where's the blood?

00:52:30.731 --> 00:52:32.941
I've never seen
a sicario use a beanbag round.

00:52:32.942 --> 00:52:34.776
Okay, one other possibility.

00:52:34.777 --> 00:52:39.364
Both places that got hit were
places that we were up on.

00:52:39.365 --> 00:52:40.866
You thinking an inside job?

00:52:40.867 --> 00:52:43.159
We were up in a lot of places,
didn't mean anything.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.537
Think about this. In the middle
of robbing El Viejo,

00:52:45.538 --> 00:52:48.290
the thieves take the time
to take our GPS tracker off.

00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:50.000
- Like they knew it was there.
- Yeah.

00:52:50.001 --> 00:52:51.751
Or they were smart enough
to check

00:52:51.752 --> 00:52:53.253
for trackers
on a cartel vehicle.

00:52:53.254 --> 00:52:54.754
- I'd check.
- So it was you?

00:52:54.755 --> 00:52:56.923
Yeah, it was me.
I robbed El Viejo.

00:52:56.924 --> 00:52:59.384
You know
who uses beanbag rounds?

00:52:59.385 --> 00:53:02.430
Law enforcement.
You know who else? Nobody.

00:53:04.348 --> 00:53:06.057
Yeah, well,
it can't be one of us.

00:53:06.058 --> 00:53:07.976
Nobody'd be crazy enough
to pull that shit.

00:53:07.977 --> 00:53:12.022
Okay, so maybe it's not
one of us but it's a big office.

00:53:12.023 --> 00:53:13.608
Look around.

00:53:14.483 --> 00:53:16.777
Yeah... okay.

00:53:18.112 --> 00:53:20.697
From now on,
everything's on lockdown.

00:53:20.698 --> 00:53:23.199
Any information on the Cabreras
stays close hold.

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.284
Yep.

00:53:24.285 --> 00:53:26.745
We got something
off the wiretaps.

00:53:26.746 --> 00:53:29.749
Talk about a new tunnel.
We got a location.

00:53:49.602 --> 00:53:51.228
SMILE!

00:53:55.942 --> 00:53:57.485
Masks up! Masks up!!

00:54:00.363 --> 00:54:02.406
They knew we were up
on that phone.

00:54:03.616 --> 00:54:06.452
Yeah, you're right.
We got a problem.

00:54:08.663 --> 00:54:10.331
Shit!

00:54:12.959 --> 00:54:14.460
Goddamn!

00:54:25.054 --> 00:54:29.350
Wow, look at this place.
Nice work.

00:54:30.393 --> 00:54:32.143
Papito will be proud of you.

00:54:32.144 --> 00:54:34.021
That's all I need.

00:54:34.939 --> 00:54:37.733
How soon
until we're operational?

00:54:38.776 --> 00:54:40.111
Beer truck arrives on Tuesday.

00:54:40.861 --> 00:54:42.488
Mm-hm. Yeah, I know.

00:54:43.614 --> 00:54:44.614
Look.

00:54:44.615 --> 00:54:47.618
Surprise! Look at this.

00:54:48.452 --> 00:54:50.370
Picture of the day.

00:54:50.371 --> 00:54:52.081
Oh, look at this guy.

00:54:53.541 --> 00:54:56.419
Look, how handsome!

00:54:58.921 --> 00:55:00.464
-  Hey...
- Hey.

00:55:11.017 --> 00:55:14.228
Hey... I need
to give you a curfew.

00:55:14.979 --> 00:55:16.771
What? Why? What did I do?

00:55:16.772 --> 00:55:19.774
It's not you. I can't have you
out late right now.

00:55:19.775 --> 00:55:21.693
So from now on,
be home by 9:00, okay?

00:55:21.694 --> 00:55:23.653
Come on... that's bullshit.

00:55:23.654 --> 00:55:26.072
- Cody, don't start.
- If the cartel's gonna whack us,

00:55:26.073 --> 00:55:28.324
I'm pretty sure they can do it
during business hours.

00:55:28.325 --> 00:55:31.327
What is your game plan here?
Work till one of us is dead?

00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:32.997
You're gonna lock me in my room

00:55:33.122 --> 00:55:34.789
so you can fight your war
on drugs?

00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:39.586
By the way, drugs have won.
I'm 18. You can't control me.

00:55:39.587 --> 00:55:41.546
- Cody...
- What are you gonna do?

00:55:41.547 --> 00:55:43.007
Cody!

00:55:43.591 --> 00:55:44.549
Cody!

00:56:43.818 --> 00:56:47.112
Yeah, no. Lucy, no, of course.
You're so welcome.

00:56:47.113 --> 00:56:49.615
It really wasn't even
that much money.

00:56:51.617 --> 00:56:53.452
Can you say that again?

00:56:54.662 --> 00:56:56.079
Wow. No, that's great.

00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.126
You know how much we all care
about you? Say hi to Jesse.

00:57:02.586 --> 00:57:04.546
That was, uh, Lucy Padilla.

00:57:04.547 --> 00:57:06.631
She called to thank everybody
for the money.

00:57:06.632 --> 00:57:09.509
Apparently, there was about
80 grand in the GoFundMe.

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:12.095
In the last couple of weeks,
it's gone up to 300 grand.

00:57:12.096 --> 00:57:14.264
- Uh, that's...
- Yeah...

00:57:14.265 --> 00:57:16.683
Wash, get me a list of all
the staffers who were read in.

00:57:16.684 --> 00:57:19.185
Sit 'em down and ask for alibis.
They're gonna be pissed,

00:57:19.186 --> 00:57:20.687
- but let's do it.
- Yep, on it.

00:57:20.688 --> 00:57:22.814
All right, it must have
gone viral or something

00:57:22.815 --> 00:57:25.151
because we are getting
like a ton of donations.

00:57:26.068 --> 00:57:27.402
Oh... there's Cody.

00:57:27.403 --> 00:57:28.987
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

00:57:28.988 --> 00:57:31.072
- Tell him the good news.
- Yeah, okay.

00:57:31.073 --> 00:57:34.492
So that GoFundMe, it's at six
figures and it's still going.

00:57:34.493 --> 00:57:37.203
What?! That's... I'm so happy
to hear that, man. That's great.

00:57:37.204 --> 00:57:40.123
It's a miracle, man,
like straight up.

00:57:40.124 --> 00:57:42.750
We might be able to buy a house
and move back to El Paso,

00:57:42.751 --> 00:57:44.377
which would be incredible.

00:57:44.378 --> 00:57:46.504
God, a house.
I love that for you guys.

00:57:46.505 --> 00:57:48.756
- Oh, we gotta go.
- Cool, bye.

00:57:48.757 --> 00:57:51.885
- Oh, if only he knew.
- I got plans for the next one.

00:57:51.886 --> 00:57:54.637
- Say what now?
- I have good intel from my dad.

00:57:54.638 --> 00:57:56.681
- We can't quit now.
- We already quit.

00:57:56.682 --> 00:57:58.600
While we're ahead.
That's when you quit.

00:57:58.601 --> 00:58:00.727
We get a little something
for us this time.

00:58:00.728 --> 00:58:01.811
You're almost 18.

00:58:01.812 --> 00:58:03.855
We could go as far away
from El Paso as we want.

00:58:03.856 --> 00:58:06.482
We could go to school,
start a business, travel.

00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:09.152
- Easy, man.
- Kyle, come on. What do you say?

00:58:09.153 --> 00:58:11.447
- Um...
- One more time?

00:58:11.572 --> 00:58:14.282
I don't know,
maybe if everyone else is, sure.

00:58:14.283 --> 00:58:16.535
- No, well everybody isn't.
- Yeah, and Jesse's good.

00:58:17.286 --> 00:58:19.287
We're done, we can chill now.
This isn't us.

00:58:19.288 --> 00:58:22.290
You do know that our parents
don't give a shit about us.

00:58:22.291 --> 00:58:24.459
They could get shot tomorrow,
we'd have nothing.

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.377
I'll speak for myself,
I'd have had nothing.

00:58:26.378 --> 00:58:28.296
I'm already down one parent.
So is Jesse.

00:58:28.297 --> 00:58:29.839
Screw the cartel and the DEA.

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.258
We hit the slash truck,
we are free from all of it.

00:58:32.259 --> 00:58:35.511
Look, man, I don't know
if you're on your period or...

00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:38.014
but...

00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:39.391
Deni, are you okay?

00:58:40.184 --> 00:58:42.810
-  Oh my God, Deni.
-  Crap. Oh, shit.

00:58:42.811 --> 00:58:44.896
- Deni?
-  Deni, you okay?

00:58:44.897 --> 00:58:47.315
- Whoa... Deni...
-  Lie down, lie down.

00:58:47.316 --> 00:58:49.235
Want some water?

00:58:50.402 --> 00:58:51.904
Deni?

00:59:30.067 --> 00:59:33.362
Hey... Hey, baby.
Deni, hey. Hey.

00:59:34.488 --> 00:59:36.322
How long does the sedative last?

00:59:36.323 --> 00:59:37.908
She'll come around soon.

00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:44.455
- Hey. You okay?
- Yep.

00:59:44.456 --> 00:59:46.207
- Yeah?
- How is she?

00:59:46.208 --> 00:59:48.002
They're gonna run
some more tests,

00:59:48.127 --> 00:59:49.544
but it's a concussion.

00:59:49.545 --> 00:59:50.795
Delayed onset, they said,

00:59:50.796 --> 00:59:53.881
but I think she fell down
some stairs last week.

00:59:53.882 --> 00:59:55.592
She was fine until today.

00:59:55.718 --> 00:59:57.969
I'm glad you were there.
It could have been a lot worse.

00:59:57.970 --> 00:59:59.178
Yeah.

00:59:59.179 --> 01:00:02.223
I just came to drop Lizzy off,
but I gotta get back to work.

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.309
- Okay, I'll see you at home.
- Bye.

01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:05.894
- Hey, Cody...
- Yeah.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.022
When did you say
Deni fell down the stairs?

01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:16.030
I'm not sure. I wasn't there.
I think last week sometime.

01:00:18.574 --> 01:00:21.243
- Okay.
- Yeah. See you.

01:00:36.008 --> 01:00:40.304
Your mom said I could see you,
if you want to see me.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.434
How you feeling?

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.311
Oh, so wiped.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:51.189
I'm sorry. I was being
a total asshole and...

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:55.526
You didn't give me a concussion,
but agree on the asshole part.

01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:58.697
Is there anything I can do?
I want to make it up to you.

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:01.742
Stay here a while.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.206
Well, thanks for being here.
I know you don't like hospitals.

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:11.542
It's all good.

01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:13.337
What's going on with you, Cody?

01:01:14.922 --> 01:01:16.465
My dad...

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.386
Same shit.
I'd rather not talk about it.

01:01:21.387 --> 01:01:24.807
That's too bad because I want
to talk about it. So...

01:01:26.475 --> 01:01:31.688
Your dad is a protector type.
Classic dude.

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:36.984
And when your mom got sick,
he couldn't do shit about it.

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:39.445
He couldn't save her.
Nobody could.

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:42.991
All he could do
was watch it happen.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.744
Now it's just him and you
and he is terrified

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:49.248
of losing
the last person he's got.

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.583
Terrified.

01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:54.919
So if he keeps you
on a short leash,

01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:00.342
that's not 'cause he thinks
you're weak or a little kid.

01:02:02.136 --> 01:02:06.557
It's that he loves you.
Your dad loves you, Cody.

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:12.354
That's how he shows it, because
he doesn't know any other way.

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:49.849
Oh my God, I'm so glad
she's okay. Say hi for me.

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:51.559
Yeah, I will.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:56.147
Not to freak you out,
but my mom's old-fashioned.

01:02:56.148 --> 01:02:57.148
Uh-oh.

01:02:57.149 --> 01:03:00.026
No, no. Nothing bad.
It's just she wants to meet you.

01:03:00.027 --> 01:03:03.447
Would you mind coming for dinner
maybe on Thursday?

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.699
I'd be very grateful.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.826
Oh, when you put it like that.

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:11.288
Shut up! See you on Thursday.

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:16.083
Beer truck will gas up.
We'll hit it right there.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:19.086
I don't know. It's only
scheduled to stop this one time

01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:22.423
and you know that truck stop's
gonna be all lit up.

01:03:22.424 --> 01:03:26.177
If there was a way to do it,
you know I'm down. It's just...

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:28.304
I don't see it.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:31.349
All right, guys.
I cannot stress this enough.

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:34.727
Details of this operation
do not leave this room.

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:37.104
All right, the beer truck
is gonna refuel here.

01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:40.399
This truck stop on Highway 62
just after dark. Right?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.111
After it fuels up, it's gonna be
on this empty stretch of highway

01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:46.532
and that's where
we're gonna grab it.

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:02.755
Hey, I'm sorry, but something
came up. I can't make Thursday.

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:05.258
Don't be a dick.
You can't cancel on my mother.

01:04:05.259 --> 01:04:07.927
- I'll make it up to you.
- I don't think so.

01:04:07.928 --> 01:04:10.263
Friday... You and your mom,
you come over here.

01:04:10.264 --> 01:04:14.183
My dad and I will happily make
dinner for you. So is that cool?

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.686
Actually...

01:04:16.562 --> 01:04:20.314
Yes. That would be really sweet.
My mom would like that.

01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:22.400
- Okay, great.
- You're still a dick though.

01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:23.652
Total dick.

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:29.157
-  Hey.
- Hey.

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.828
Can I,
uh, ask you about something?

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:37.790
Yeah. Sure. What's up?

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:42.129
I didn't want to tell you
at first and I should have.

01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:46.882
I'm seeing a girl at school.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.302
She invited me
to have dinner with her mom.

01:04:49.303 --> 01:04:52.763
And, of course, I said yes,
but then I had to cancel, so...

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:54.640
Why'd you cancel?

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:57.184
You know,
wrestling practice and all that.

01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:59.186
I also promised Deni
that I'd visit her.

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:02.023
Um, and I kind of told her

01:05:02.024 --> 01:05:04.650
that her and her mom could come
over this Friday for dinner.

01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:06.944
I'm sorry. I know I should have
checked in with you, but--

01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:09.739
- You need me to bail out?
- Yeah.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.326
Bro' code, right? Okay.

01:05:12.993 --> 01:05:14.535
- Awesome--
- Hey.

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:18.080
Did you hear anything about
the GoFundMe for Lucy and Jesse?

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:19.915
Yeah, no, yeah.
Jesse called me

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:23.210
and apparently, like it blew up
on TikTok or something.

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:25.671
It's... it's crazy. Yeah.

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:29.217
Thank God for TikTok,
whatever that is.

01:05:31.303 --> 01:05:32.846
Just kidding.

01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:36.849
I'll be home late tomorrow,
but you be home by 9:00.

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:38.809
- Of course.
-  See you.

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:39.936
See you.

01:05:45.025 --> 01:05:46.776
It'll work. I'm positive.

01:05:46.777 --> 01:05:49.278
- What if the forecast is wrong?
- Then we'll bail.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:52.198
Okay, I'm bailing.
I've already bailed.

01:05:52.199 --> 01:05:55.368
Fine. Me and Kyle
can do this on our own.

01:05:55.369 --> 01:05:57.871
- You're gonna get killed!
- We got this.

01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:28.527
The forecast is right.
The wind is kicking up good.

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:29.903
Let's go.

01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:46.878
In position.

01:06:47.546 --> 01:06:49.381
In position.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.595
In position.

01:07:01.727 --> 01:07:03.936
Keep your eyes
on the beer truck.

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:06.355
It looks like
they got an escort.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.441
Copy that. See the beer truck.

01:07:08.442 --> 01:07:10.569
One follow vehicle,
three inside.

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:25.542
Let's go!

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:34.467
- All right.
- Ready? Let's do this.

01:07:34.468 --> 01:07:35.761
Okay.

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:40.640
All right. Now!

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:45.853
What the hell?

01:07:45.854 --> 01:07:48.189
- Ray, what are we doing?
- Wash, hold your position.

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:49.899
Albright, Matthews,
let's take 'em there.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.067
Copy that. Let's go.

01:07:51.193 --> 01:07:52.985
Don't let them
get back out on the road.

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:54.196
Let's go!

01:08:07.793 --> 01:08:13.465
Shit! No keys! Crap!
Check his pockets!

01:08:14.466 --> 01:08:16.510
Here they are!

01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:24.351
DEA, everyone on the ground!
DEA, get down.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:30.607
- Oh, shit!
- Kyle, let's move.

01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:33.443
DEA!

01:08:33.985 --> 01:08:35.778
Get down. Get down!

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:37.864
Shit, that's my mom!

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.663
DEA, on the ground!

01:08:46.164 --> 01:08:47.791
Drop your weapon!

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:01.136
-  Kyle, come on.
- Okay, okay.

01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:02.889
Let's go, let's go!

01:09:39.134 --> 01:09:41.177
 Wash,
beer truck heading your way.

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:46.807
- I'm on it. I'll take it out.
- Stand down. Stand down.

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:48.727
I'm on it!

01:09:50.186 --> 01:09:53.814
I just wanna go home. I'm sorry.
This isn't what I signed up for!

01:09:53.815 --> 01:09:56.526
- We're good, we're good!
- No, we're not!

01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:58.527
Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit.

01:09:58.528 --> 01:10:00.697
I got this!

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:05.910
What the hell?!

01:10:05.911 --> 01:10:07.537
Wash, stand down.

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:11.082
Cody, slow down!

01:10:12.292 --> 01:10:14.961
Stand down! That's an order!

01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:27.849
Goddammit!

01:10:31.478 --> 01:10:34.730
- You okay?
- No! I'm not okay, Cody!

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:36.732
I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:38.902
I just wanna go home, bro'.
I wanna go home.

01:11:09.516 --> 01:11:12.768
Hey... hey! What was that?
What's going on?

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:15.689
- Get a look at them?
- I could have followed them!

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:19.275
Ray, I know what's going on!

01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:27.241
Padilla, wasn't your fault.
It wasn't mine, okay?

01:11:27.242 --> 01:11:30.369
It happened.
And he'd want us to keep going.

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:34.124
He'd want to keep taking risks.
To do our jobs.

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:39.295
Yeah, I know.
I know you're right. Thanks.

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:54.227
Oh my God.

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:56.687
What did you do?

01:11:56.688 --> 01:11:59.398
I know.
That got way out of hand.

01:11:59.399 --> 01:12:01.442
- You think?
- Yvonne, our parents were there.

01:12:01.443 --> 01:12:02.985
What? Are they okay?

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:04.904
Yeah, they're fine.
That was a mess.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.163
They're not cold.

01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:18.293
- No way.
- Where's the cash?

01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:23.505
Oh, God.

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:25.925
Cody, stop!
Stop! There's no cash!

01:12:27.302 --> 01:12:28.844
This is worth, I don't know...

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:30.346
A million. Tens of millions!

01:12:30.472 --> 01:12:33.140
The money we stole
from the cartel was nothing!

01:12:33.141 --> 01:12:34.933
They're gonna be
looking for it!

01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:35.934
I know!

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:37.644
What if there's
a tracking beacon in there?

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:39.146
- There's not!
- How do you know?

01:12:39.147 --> 01:12:41.858
Because we'd already be dead!

01:12:54.621 --> 01:12:57.122
Yvonne told me.
Goddamn it, Cody!

01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:59.750
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're cleaning it up now.

01:12:59.751 --> 01:13:01.919
We should have quit
after El Viejo.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.297
This is over, Cody.
It has to be.

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:07.175
Yeah, it's definitely over.

01:13:35.829 --> 01:13:39.206
Hey. So I sat down with everyone
who was read in on the Cabreras.

01:13:39.207 --> 01:13:41.458
They all had alibis
for all the heists.

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:43.794
Yeah, good. Yep.

01:13:43.795 --> 01:13:46.713
That doesn't mean they couldn't
have passed the intel on.

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:49.258
To friends or family, even.

01:13:49.259 --> 01:13:52.094
Yeah, they could've.
A lot of possibilities.

01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:53.596
Yeah.

01:13:55.390 --> 01:14:00.520
Well, if we don't get 'em,
the cartel will, right?

01:14:01.563 --> 01:14:03.439
And they don't forget.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:21.373
Cody, come out here.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.084
Jesus, I thought you forgot.

01:14:25.003 --> 01:14:27.005
Oh, dammit.

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:35.471
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:38.098
Hi!

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:41.018
Hi, uh, please come in.
You look great.

01:14:41.019 --> 01:14:43.395
- Thanks.
- Yeah, Dad, Teresa. Teresa, Dad.

01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:44.396
Hi.

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:45.606
Mr Seale,
it's really nice to meet you.

01:14:45.607 --> 01:14:47.774
- Yeah, likewise. Call me Ray.
- Ray, this is my mother.

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:49.026
- Hi Ray.
- How are you?

01:14:49.027 --> 01:14:50.360
- Call me Lydia.
- Lydia...

01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:52.863
- Cody, nice to finally meet you.
- Yeah.

01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:54.740
Teresa talks about you
all the time.

01:14:54.741 --> 01:14:56.451
- Right?
- Mom...

01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:59.411
All right... come on in.

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:01.538
See, I already embarrassed her.

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:04.250
Well, that's what parents
are for, right?

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.879
We were mostly commercial,

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.672
but now we're focusing
on residential.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:12.841
It's like everyone's moving
to Texas.

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:13.800
Yeah, exactly.

01:15:13.801 --> 01:15:15.761
- That's where all the money is.
- You okay?

01:15:15.762 --> 01:15:17.430
Yeah.

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:21.392
Um... excuse me,
uh, where's your restroom?

01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:24.353
Down the hallway,
second door to the right.

01:15:24.354 --> 01:15:26.189
Gotcha.

01:15:30.652 --> 01:15:33.695
Did you cook?
This is delicious.

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:35.907
Thank you.

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:10.399
- Oh man, seven hours.
- Seven hours.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.734
- Yeah, about seven hours.
- Oh wow, that's a long time.

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:14.946
Yeah. Used to go up there
fishing all the time.

01:16:19.242 --> 01:16:22.619
Being a single parent
is tough, right?

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.371
How have you managed it?

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:27.124
I had to let go
of the idea of perfect.

01:16:27.125 --> 01:16:29.710
Perfect went out the door
along with her dad.

01:16:29.711 --> 01:16:32.463
I've settled for the best I can.

01:16:34.007 --> 01:16:37.050
Looks like you're doing
a great job with him.

01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:40.429
Uh... Yeah, I mean, I hope so.

01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:43.473
No one ever tells you if you're
being a bad parent, you know?

01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:45.267
Yeah, figure it out on your own.

01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:47.478
Cody's a good kid.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.397
Got a great heart.

01:16:50.398 --> 01:16:54.068
Just makes
bad decisions sometimes.

01:16:56.029 --> 01:16:58.990
Sorry, I'm not trying to scare
your daughter off or anything.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:02.617
Don't worry. No chance of that.

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:03.995
Yeah.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.914
Family's hard.
Oh, trust me, I know.

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:09.207
Yeah.

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:12.002
What's the saying?
You choose your friends...

01:17:12.003 --> 01:17:13.503
- But not your family.
- Yeah.

01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:15.005
- Right, cheers to that.
- Salud.

01:17:15.006 --> 01:17:16.757
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks for coming.

01:17:16.758 --> 01:17:18.968
- Pleasure. Pleasure.
- Bye, Cody.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:33.357
- Is everything okay?
- Let's get out of town tomorrow.

01:17:33.358 --> 01:17:36.318
Go fishing. We haven't done
that in a long time.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:38.863
Give us a chance to talk.

01:17:40.948 --> 01:17:42.533
All right.

01:17:44.869 --> 01:17:46.370
Good job.

01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:48.581
They'll lead us
to the whole DEA team.

01:17:52.794 --> 01:17:54.670
What?

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:19.444
Hey, what's up?

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:23.825
 Hey, Cody.
Thanks for dinner tonight.

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:25.784
Teresa?!

01:18:25.785 --> 01:18:27.702
I did enjoy getting to know you.

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:30.330
You won't believe me after this,
but it's true.

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:33.000
Now we want our beer truck back
with everything inside of it.

01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:38.547
- Where's Deni?
- It's important you stay calm.

01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:40.715
- It's important for Deni.
- Let me talk to her.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.552
Okay.

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:45.637
Cody, don't come over here!

01:18:46.973 --> 01:18:49.891
Okay, just... just tell me
what you want.

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:52.018
I'm gonna send you a location.

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:54.646
Be here with our beer truck
within two hours or Deni dies.

01:18:54.647 --> 01:18:58.483
Daddy shows up, Deni dies too.
Are you clear?

01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:03.990
- Yes.
- Guess I'll see you soon.

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:52.098
Cody! Get down!

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:10.283
Wash, I'm under attack.
My cover's blown. Call everyone.

01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:33.055
Shit.

01:21:50.323 --> 01:21:52.282
Hey, everyone okay?

01:21:52.283 --> 01:21:54.618
Albright and Reynolds are fine.
They're at the office now

01:21:54.619 --> 01:21:56.703
- locking it down.
- Thank God.

01:21:56.704 --> 01:21:59.706
Listen, you said Cody was
visiting Deni at the hospital,

01:21:59.707 --> 01:22:01.666
I'm here now,
and she's not in her room.

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:03.502
Matthews is freaking out.

01:22:05.755 --> 01:22:10.091
Run a trace on Cody's phone.
Get his current location.

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:13.053
And run ID checks
on Lydia and Teresa Flores.

01:22:13.054 --> 01:22:17.141
Okay. Listen, everything's
going to be fine. Okay?

01:22:55.971 --> 01:23:00.600
Lydia Flores... EPPD just got
to her house. It's been torched.

01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:03.229
No sign of her or the daughter.

01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:27.293
Run silent.

01:23:27.294 --> 01:23:29.504
Approach the extraction
with extreme caution.

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.423
Watch your crossfire
and watch your backdrop.

01:23:50.568 --> 01:23:53.154
Don't shoot, I have a bomb
in here. Don't shoot!

01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:04.330
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
I have a bomb!

01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:06.082
A bomb?

01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:07.710
You are a mad scientist.

01:24:18.763 --> 01:24:20.764
It could be real,
he knows this stuff.

01:24:20.765 --> 01:24:22.307
We were in chem class together.

01:24:22.308 --> 01:24:24.768
Isn't that right, Cody?
Those were fun times.

01:24:24.769 --> 01:24:26.686
Did you know the whole time?

01:24:26.687 --> 01:24:29.773
We knew there were DEA kids at
school, but we didn't know who.

01:24:29.774 --> 01:24:31.858
I saw you hanging out.
Such a weird group of friends.

01:24:31.859 --> 01:24:33.526
It made me curious.

01:24:33.527 --> 01:24:34.903
Then after the tunnel raid,
we wondered

01:24:34.904 --> 01:24:37.280
if we'd made an orphan,

01:24:37.281 --> 01:24:39.365
but I wasn't sure
until after you and I hooked up.

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:45.915
Good for you.

01:24:46.665 --> 01:24:47.916
You win.

01:24:47.917 --> 01:24:49.960
Now just let Deni go.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.469
Look, very good!

01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:00.804
Truck looks nice.

01:25:00.805 --> 01:25:03.348
But why are they still alive?

01:25:03.349 --> 01:25:05.892
- I'm gonna light this up!
-  No, you're not.

01:25:05.893 --> 01:25:07.602
That's not a bomb.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:09.521
- Look at him, he's all talk!
- Watch me!

01:25:09.522 --> 01:25:11.857
- We are!
- Kill this mother--

01:25:21.992 --> 01:25:23.451
Shit.

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:25.496
Kill him. Kill him!

01:25:27.665 --> 01:25:29.542
Kill that bastard!

01:25:41.053 --> 01:25:43.138
Motherfuckers!

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:49.562
Damn.

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.410
Over here!

01:26:13.002 --> 01:26:14.670
Let's go!

01:26:18.799 --> 01:26:20.718
Get down. Get down!

01:26:30.644 --> 01:26:31.644
Go, go, go!

01:26:31.645 --> 01:26:33.605
Let's take her. We'll trade her.

01:26:33.606 --> 01:26:35.399
Go with your sister.

01:26:37.985 --> 01:26:39.736
-  Benito!
- I'll meet you later.

01:26:39.737 --> 01:26:42.322
- Look after your sister!
-  Hurry up!

01:26:42.323 --> 01:26:43.866
Go!

01:26:59.006 --> 01:27:00.883
Goddamnit, Cody!

01:27:01.759 --> 01:27:03.344
Hey!

01:27:09.308 --> 01:27:11.518
- Shit!
- Goddamn it, Ray!

01:27:15.064 --> 01:27:16.106
Ray!

01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:23.989
-  And Benito?
-  He's dead.

01:27:34.291 --> 01:27:36.918
Stop!
I'm sick of you, brat!

01:27:36.919 --> 01:27:39.463
Are you crazy or what?

01:27:40.089 --> 01:27:42.216
Natalia, behind you!

01:27:46.011 --> 01:27:48.138
No!

01:27:51.642 --> 01:27:53.477
No!

01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:56.270
Ray, where are you?

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:59.108
- Down the tunnel ahead of you.
-  Deni.

01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:02.111
No.

01:28:02.653 --> 01:28:04.153
Dad, I'm sorry!

01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:06.155
I'm sorry!

01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:07.407
Shut up.

01:28:07.408 --> 01:28:09.909
Stop. Stop.
Dad, please stop!

01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:13.914
- Shut up.
- Please stop.

01:28:18.502 --> 01:28:19.502
Ray!

01:28:19.503 --> 01:28:22.088
Listen. They kidnapped you
and Deni from the hospital.

01:28:22.089 --> 01:28:24.507
They beat the shit out of you.
They brought you here. Got it?

01:28:24.508 --> 01:28:26.968
They kidnapped you and beat
the shit out of you. Got it?

01:28:26.969 --> 01:28:29.220
- Ray?!
- You understand? I'm sorry.

01:28:29.221 --> 01:28:31.222
- We're good.
- Good?

01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:33.933
Yeah. We're good. Yeah.

01:28:33.934 --> 01:28:35.853
Deni! Are you okay?

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:41.984
What happened?

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:45.279
Um... They um...

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:50.825
They... They beat the shit
out of me and Deni.

01:28:50.826 --> 01:28:53.954
Kidnapped us from the hospital
and brought us here.

01:28:56.915 --> 01:28:59.917
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, Mom, I'm okay.

01:29:07.551 --> 01:29:10.304
I love you, Cody.
I love you, son.

01:29:11.972 --> 01:29:14.933
I love you too, Dad. I love you.

01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:25.527
Good?

01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:27.905
Yeah.

01:29:29.281 --> 01:29:31.784
He'll be okay. He's tough.

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:35.537
They're done, right?

01:29:38.248 --> 01:29:41.001
- What do you mean?
- The kids, they're done...

01:29:41.126 --> 01:29:42.586
being morons.

01:29:47.007 --> 01:29:48.926
They fucking better be.

01:29:51.345 --> 01:29:53.304
Come on.

01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:02.396
Guys, let's start
with your 50-50 collar tie-up.

01:30:02.397 --> 01:30:04.023
- Hey, Ray.
- Yep.

01:30:04.024 --> 01:30:06.068
Got to take it easy
on the boss' kid?

01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:10.989
No, he can take care of himself.

01:30:15.536 --> 01:30:18.079
There it is. Nice.
Guys, change partners.

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.289
Come on, kid.

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:22.000
- You and me, buddy.
- All right.

01:31:07.171 --> 01:31:09.923
This is no way to live,
Papito.

01:31:30.444 --> 01:31:32.321
Welcome home!

01:31:34.156 --> 01:31:36.365
- Oh my God.
-  Good to see you.

01:31:36.366 --> 01:31:38.619
You're back. I'm so happy.

01:31:40.204 --> 01:31:42.079
Oh, yes.
Did you bring Mexican?

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.582
- Uh... sushi.
- Sushi? Fancy.

01:31:44.583 --> 01:31:47.627
Um, well,
welcome to our new house.

01:31:47.628 --> 01:31:49.337
