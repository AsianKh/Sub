1
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:46,602
Come on, brother!

2
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:11,839
Watch out!

3
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:13,260
For me, brother.

4
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:15,380
Okay.

5
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,396
What, is it broken?

6
00:01:51,806 --> 00:01:53,009
Hey, brother!

7
00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:54,354
Go.

8
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:55,166
Let go.

9
00:01:58,585 --> 00:01:59,585
You are alone, brother.

10
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:00,824
Roll a five.

11
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:11,390
I have to go back, brother.

12
00:02:12,162 --> 00:02:15,275
Brother, answer one question before you leave.

13
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,722
How did he die?

14
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,973
He was shot dead.

15
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,087
We could have escaped, but I insisted on getting Spider.

16
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:34,258
So we have to go back.

17
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:37,001
It's not your fault. How did he die?

18
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,919
We shouldn't have been there.

19
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:44,560
It's my fault they caught us because I disobeyed orders.

20
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,000
Just you and the girl.

21
00:02:56,762 --> 00:02:57,762
Hi, Brother.

22
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,000
Skxawng (stupid).

23
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,438
I killed my brother.

24
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,592
No matter what happens, I will have to carry this burden for the rest of my life.

25
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:53,933
I wish I could do that.

26
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:56,278
I wish I could do that.

27
00:03:57,846 --> 00:04:01,047
I wish I could be underwater again.

28
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:03,641
Yes, you defeated me without a mask.

29
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,126
"So" boss?

30
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's try it and see what happens.

31
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:11,024
Beware of snakes, beware of snakes.

32
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,140
Tako zna�i, ha?

33
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:41,000
The fire of hatred is merely the ashes of grief.

34
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:44,000
My mother is grieving in an old-fashioned way,

35
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:47,314
by singing the story of her son's life during the solar eclipse.

36
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:51,000
Because the light always returns.

37
00:04:59,987 --> 00:05:04,006
There is the way of the Na'vi and there is the way of my father.

38
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,000
Silence, engrossed in work.

39
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,000
The inhabitants of the reef say the sea will cleanse you.

40
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,000
It washes away your sins.

41
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,194
...

42
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,853
You should have collected weapons; I consider you useless.

43
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,326
Focus, my child.

44
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,214
Don't let your mother see it.

45
00:06:30,151 --> 00:06:32,340
We're sorry.

46
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:33,511
Tuk.

47
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,589
Weapons.

48
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:44,997
Fun.

49
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:47,297
What is that?

50
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,300
The child.

51
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:52,258
"To be removed from the register"?

52
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,228
It's an assault rifle, isn't it?

53
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,733
Here is the magazine where the ammunition is stored.

54
00:06:58,758 --> 00:06:59,688
It is empty.

55
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
I'm sure of it.

56
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:03,819
You are welcome.

57
00:07:04,243 --> 00:07:06,399
There you go! You can shoot.

58
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:08,546
With this you can kill many celestial beings.

59
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:10,205
Look, ceramic mechanism.

60
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,733
Clean it with oil, then it will be like new.

61
00:07:13,003 --> 00:07:15,873
That's not how the Na'vi operate, Jake Sully.

62
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,000
Metal weapons are prohibited.

63
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:19,713
So.

64
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:21,438
Touch poisons the heart.

65
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,000
Eywa will show you the way.

66
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:29,799
The mourning period is not yet over.

67
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,347
Tuk, you should be with your family instead of picking up this stuff.

68
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,000
Your wife needs you.

69
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:41,619
My son rests with his ancestors on the mountain ridge.

70
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:44,068
This is our home.

71
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,210
I said I would stay and fight, but no.

72
00:07:46,222 --> 00:07:48,434
You can fight warships with spears.

73
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,701
We sank the demon ship.

74
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,000
The celestial beings now fear us.

75
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes, we were lucky.

76
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,859
But they still own many ships.

77
00:07:57,926 --> 00:07:59,925
At least we have that.

78
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,992
We're happy to have you with us, Jake Sully.

79
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:07,579
We don't need weapons, but the rider of the last shadow.

80
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:13,103
A rider of the Great Toruk, as you once were.

81
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,500
When you ride this being, you become a part of it.

82
00:08:20,226 --> 00:08:23,226
And the more blood, the worse.

83
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:27,869
I will no longer be Toruk Makto.

84
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,940
Jake Sully, you're still Toruk Makto.

85
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,913
Los, Rotxo.

86
00:08:42,426 --> 00:08:43,826
Can you hear me?

87
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:46,931
Yes, we can hear you perfectly. Please continue, Dom.

88
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,000
We searched the wreck inside and out.

89
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:54,000
We searched a radius of 200 meters.

90
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,968
There are no Na'vi bodies.

91
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,653
Only the crew. Okay.

92
00:08:58,513 --> 00:09:00,814
Their remains. We continue the search.

93
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,200
We need to expand the search radius. Understood.

94
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:07,224
Note: I found nothing. No seaweed.

95
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:09,755
Halo.

96
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,860
Sully is still at large somewhere.

97
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,976
We don't know if the vultures carried the body away.

98
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:17,000
No, he escaped.

99
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,475
And he is located in this area.

100
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,530
There are only a few villages left. Give me a boat, and I will…

101
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:25,236
I have already given you the ship. It lies on the seabed.

102
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:28,260
Yes, with my crew.

103
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,000
They are all dead.

104
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:36,278
You made me travel 26 billion kilometers for a single mission.

105
00:09:36,423 --> 00:09:39,773
Kinetic attack against a man.

106
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,000
I will not find peace.

107
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,233
Okay. Hello.

108
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:50,931
Are you leaving me here?

109
00:09:58,385 --> 00:10:01,213
The ghosts of my ancestors are in the harbor.

110
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,720
That is our strength.

111
00:10:07,598 --> 00:10:10,000
I can help you fix that, Lo'ak.

112
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,050
No!

113
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:15,926
It's destroyed!

114
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,960
Everything I touch is destroyed.

115
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,906
They never talk about it.

116
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:28,899
But it will be destroyed.

117
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:31,746
Like a snoring Denador.

118
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:37,000
I know you'll never let go of your bow.

119
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,324
For this reason …

120
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:46,786
Don't get too close when it happens.

121
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:08,866
Will Znaïi kill Ronal?

122
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:15,658
I will not stand up to my husband in front of this woman.

123
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:19,813
Look, I'm a Marine.

124
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,780
A knife is not the same as a pistol.

125
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,680
Not even a prayer.

126
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:30,953
What should I do?

127
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:34,515
I can't run away. I can't defend myself.

128
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:35,933
Is that correct?

129
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,879
Eywa will show you the way.

130
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,275
Huh? And where is Eywa? Where was Eywa when our son…

131
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,560
Jake!

132
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:47,346
I am in a place where there is nothing.

133
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,919
Not my people. Not my forest.

134
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:54,680
Even my father's bow has disappeared.

135
00:11:57,374 --> 00:12:00,943
All I have left is faith.

136
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:04,256
And here is the Great Mother's plan.

137
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:08,792
There is this family.

138
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:23,786
And then there's me.

139
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,865
I love you very much too.

140
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:53,000
Everyone comes to listen to the prayer.

141
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,819
That's unbelievable!

142
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:42,562
Schnell, schnell, schnell!

143
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:50,677
That was crazy, Kaz.

144
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:52,167
Hello, my brother.

145
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:56,826
You told me that.

146
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:01,705
It's a shame that Tulkun is still an outcast.

147
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,651
Yes, even though he saved us all.

148
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:12,458
He bears the guilt of all those who fell in battle.

149
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:16,993
I'm sorry, you should have saved us all.

150
00:14:17,018 --> 00:14:18,411
No problem.

151
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:20,705
We are still brothers.

152
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,751
For all people? Forever.

153
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:40,551
Papa!

154
00:14:45,004 --> 00:14:46,603
Wait a minute, where's the spare tire? I think it's in the basket.

155
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:47,936
Wake up! Pull yourself together!

156
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:50,068
Where is the spare mask? What?

157
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:52,212
Where is the spare mask? It was here. Where is it?

158
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:54,123
Look! She's not here.

159
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:54,945
Tell me! Where is she?

160
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,685
I can't find them! Hurry!

161
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,376
Where? Come on, let's go!

162
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:01,309
I found it, Dad! Quick, I found it!

163
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,000
Diíi. Diíi.

164
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:15,575
Deep and slow.

165
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,401
So, everything's fine. Okay.

166
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,828
Understood.

167
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,000
Skxawng (stupid), you must be careful.

168
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,762
Listen, this is my name, Skxawng (stupid).

169
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,422
You need to be more careful than I am, darling.

170
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:30,247
Watch out! Stay away!

171
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:34,976
Yes, you have to be careful.

172
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,783
Skxawng (stupid) is there, in the middle.

173
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:43,000
Treacherous wind! They're coming!

174
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:46,000
The treacherous wind is approaching!

175
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,000
Go! Quick!

176
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:49,746
Let's go!

177
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:15,833
Hello!

178
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,150
Hello!

179
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,806
Just look!

180
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:43,000
Look, it doesn't take up much space.

181
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,695
Hopefully it won't cause any problems.

182
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,120
Get on your knees, come on. Knock.

183
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:50,000
Come on, Kiri, Kiri, please.

184
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:52,025
Children, sit down.

185
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,051
Your mother and I have made a decision.

186
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:04,183
Spider, you'll stay alone in the upper camp.

187
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,909
What? The treacherous wind will catch you.

188
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,807
No, Dad. Absolutely not.

189
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:09,236
Hey, Spider!

190
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,681
We cannot live with a mask on day and night.

191
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:13,464
I just want to stay here with you.

192
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:15,752
I know, but it's too risky.

193
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:17,125
That's not fair.

194
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,848
Please, you are the only family I know.

195
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,217
It's the best thing for you.

196
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:22,963
But Dad is our best friend.

197
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:24,352
Do we think we're doing something wrong?

198
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,842
It's too dangerous. We could die just because the mask runs out of power.

199
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:29,866
She belongs to this species.

200
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:32,993
Mom, what kind are you talking about?

201
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,684
Mom. An alien?

202
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:37,019
Kiri. That's enough. Stop it.

203
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:39,771
You hate her too much, that's all you see.

204
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,093
On je Spider.

205
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:43,691
Please, Jake.

206
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:46,110
Mrs. Sully, I won't disturb you. You know that.

207
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,603
Dad, this isn't normal.

208
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:49,209
The spider belongs to this family.

209
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,590
She will never belong to this family.

210
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,000
Transport in a caravan is the safest solution.

211
00:17:58,025 --> 00:17:59,700
No, please. We're leaving today.

212
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:02,048
I can't. Okay, decided.

213
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:04,976
It's a family. It's not a democracy.

214
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,000
Okay? I hate you.

215
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:09,000
He's the best, my son. No.

216
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't touch me!

217
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:13,143
Understood.

218
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:16,090
Do you understand? No.

219
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,363
I've already lost my money, brother.

220
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,469
I don't want to lose anyone else.

221
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,717
The Sully family must stick together.

222
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:32,939
Yes, that's our family motto.

223
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:39,498
Nonsense. That's not fair.

224
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,000
Okay. Hey, what do you think?

225
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
We're all going with him.

226
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:45,214
Links?

227
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,819
You said you wanted to visit your grandmother.

228
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:51,826
Yes, this will be a family outing.

229
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:57,683
Yes this is good.

230
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,384
Hey, stay here.

231
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:18,271
Our offer is only valid for the boy in pink.

232
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:21,090
That won't be a problem. You're already in trouble anyway.

233
00:19:21,323 --> 00:19:24,673
A trader must understand that he cannot take sides.

234
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:30,000
Having Toruk Makto on board is like taking sides in this war.

235
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:32,244
You could be wrong.

236
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:35,366
Oruk Makto has never been on board your ship.

237
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,580
But if he were to come on board,

238
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,783
He and his wife would be happy to fly as an escort and protect your caravan.

239
00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:49,390
Perhaps.

240
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:52,407
Mangkwan's attackers are becoming more aggressive now.

241
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:56,688
Okay. I agree.

242
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:04,162
Odve�iu�e!

243
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:06,395
The.

244
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,976
Odve�iu�e!

245
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:19,000
Listen! Listen!

246
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:22,000
Tsireya! Lo'ak!

247
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:25,000
Ready to board!

248
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:28,000
Ready to board!

249
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,883
Faster, stop!

250
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,976
The wind is blowing! Hold on tight!

251
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:42,000
Lift it up, bend it in the wind!

252
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:44,157
Laundry! Laundry!

253
00:20:52,453 --> 00:20:54,899
Life on a boat looks easy!

254
00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:03,600
The wind is blowing!

255
00:21:58,947 --> 00:22:01,561
Everyone grieves in their own way.

256
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:07,685
For me, it's the isolation here.

257
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:12,858
I feel it too.

258
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:15,769
Brother, look at this!

259
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:18,691
I hear his voice in the wind.

260
00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:35,118
Here, take this.

261
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:46,000
Dad, I've been thinking about it.

262
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:49,050
I'd better get myself a rifle, then I can fly with you.

263
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:53,279
That won't happen. Why?

264
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,175
He taught me how to shoot.

265
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,000
I know what I'm doing.

266
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,573
Turn on your communication device. I've called you five times.

267
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,000
Turn on the communication device.

268
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,000
First rule.

269
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,636
That's not possible either.

270
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,113
One of them.

271
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:27,704
"To me?"

272
00:23:27,898 --> 00:23:30,051
I promised this guy a photo if he came.

273
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,385
If he regains his strength.

274
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:35,392
Long-range patrols detected them as they were penetrating our airspace.

275
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:37,153
The route he takes.

276
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:38,779
You have reached a new level.

277
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,356
Mouse, fool.

278
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:48,132
Wind, 1350 today.

279
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,320
We have the coordinates. Get ready.

280
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,150
Thank you.

281
00:24:07,435 --> 00:24:09,000
Shipment tracking!

282
00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:10,769
Shipment tracking!

283
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:27,730
Your package.

284
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,768
Everything is fine, there's still plenty of time.

285
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,000
Overcome it.

286
00:24:57,071 --> 00:24:59,000
Jake! Back!

287
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:03,340
Here's my radar, weapons ready. Check status!

288
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm leaving. Jake, drive!

289
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:12,565
Run! Fast!

290
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:15,000
Come on, come on. It's safe.

291
00:25:25,947 --> 00:25:26,954
Fast!

292
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:28,979
Protect your brother! I understand, Lord!

293
00:25:29,472 --> 00:25:30,794
Stay in cover.

294
00:25:59,603 --> 00:26:01,173
Spider! This way!

295
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:05,765
Oh dear, my communicator!

296
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:21,221
Stay with the girls. We're safe.

297
00:26:25,331 --> 00:26:26,860
He must stay here.

298
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,561
No!

299
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:56,189
Let's go!

300
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:13,083
Back!

301
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,741
I'm on fire!

302
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:09,109
Schnell! Schnell!

303
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,469
Forward! Forward! Go!

304
00:29:11,614 --> 00:29:12,802
Fast!

305
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:21,898
Spider... Come on, quickly!

306
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,000
Let's go!

307
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,940
Hey, Neytiri, where are you?

308
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:03,513
Hey everyone, Lo'ak! Where?

309
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:05,430
Come on, we have to catch him! Quickly!

310
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:08,529
Lo'ak! Ska'i!

311
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:10,872
Lo'ak, jump! Quick!

312
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:12,336
Fast!

313
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:13,555
Los, alle!

314
00:30:26,176 --> 00:30:27,262
Oh no, Lo'ak!

315
00:30:28,256 --> 00:30:28,861
Ah!

316
00:30:36,725 --> 00:30:37,438
Oh!

317
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,720
Worth it, Tuk!

318
00:30:50,775 --> 00:30:52,931
Spider! Kiri! My leg!

319
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:57,880
Agree!

320
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:02,218
Everything okay? Tuk, everything okay?

321
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:04,791
Knock, knock, hey, is everything okay?

322
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:07,691
Yes, are you sure? Yes, you are sure.

323
00:31:07,723 --> 00:31:10,003
Duo, duo.

324
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,595
I'm sorry.

325
00:31:11,894 --> 00:31:14,053
I'm sorry. It's nothing.

326
00:31:25,536 --> 00:31:26,536
Damned!

327
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,140
Brother, my savior is on the boat.

328
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:31,566
What? My spare mask is on this boat.

329
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Damn it, Kiri, stay here.

330
00:32:24,227 --> 00:32:26,089
We have to go! Damn it!

331
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:29,343
Quick, we have to go!

332
00:32:29,368 --> 00:32:31,044
Kiri, come on, they're coming!

333
00:32:32,087 --> 00:32:32,926
Fast!

334
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:39,020
They're coming, come on, hurry up!

335
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:40,942
Go on, hurry!

336
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:44,437
Kiri, the, the, Tuk!

337
00:32:44,469 --> 00:32:45,858
Come on, hurry up!

338
00:33:10,296 --> 00:33:12,413
They're so close! They're so close! Hurry!

339
00:33:20,193 --> 00:33:23,495
What have they missed, Tsahik, just look!

340
00:33:30,253 --> 00:33:31,133
No…

341
00:33:38,707 --> 00:33:39,741
Follow me.

342
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,623
Come on, Tuk, this way!

343
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:04,452
And!

344
00:34:10,471 --> 00:34:15,735
They're coming, Tuk, come on, this way, quickly!

345
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:17,943
Further!

346
00:34:22,064 --> 00:34:27,056
Come on, this way, we need to get to the water quickly!

347
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:28,454
Come on, hurry!

348
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:29,214
Look!

349
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:30,811
Come on, Tuk, swim!

350
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,123
Look!

351
00:34:36,305 --> 00:34:38,395
I've got you, Tuk, calm down.

352
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,126
What is our motto?

353
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,841
We must stick together.

354
00:34:42,144 --> 00:34:43,581
No, the other one.

355
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:45,140
We never give up.

356
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:47,824
Exactly, we never give up.

357
00:34:51,585 --> 00:34:52,680
File.

358
00:34:53,228 --> 00:34:54,228
Leave!

359
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:56,487
Lo'ak, followed by Tuk.

360
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,480
Leave!

361
00:35:03,023 --> 00:35:04,023
Leave!

362
00:35:05,027 --> 00:35:06,027
Spider!

363
00:35:08,027 --> 00:35:09,821
Come on, hurry up!

364
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,380
Lynx eye, can you hear me?

365
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,109
Look, my son, answer me.

366
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:39,572
Neytiri, uje me?

367
00:35:43,149 --> 00:35:44,999
Neytiri, Neytiri, how are you?

368
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,806
Neytiri, uje me.

369
00:35:52,412 --> 00:35:53,412
Look!

370
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:56,363
Same!

371
00:35:57,298 --> 00:35:58,298
Look!

372
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:02,885
Come on, catch him, I've got you.

373
00:36:08,974 --> 00:36:10,920
Is everything alright? Are you feeling well?

374
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,134
Are you sure, brother? Yes, I'm fine.

375
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,600
Do you see them?

376
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:26,888
No, let's hide.

377
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:28,292
Elim to beat.

378
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:29,576
Tuk, come on.

379
00:36:29,703 --> 00:36:31,202
I am tired and hungry.

380
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:32,080
I know.

381
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:33,964
Elim ii if. If.

382
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:35,288
They don't know who we are.

383
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,253
No connection.

384
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,780
We are alone. 630 --> 00:36:42,556 Brother, I need a mask.

385
00:36:42,581 --> 00:36:43,980
What should we do?

386
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:46,344
I don't know why I'm responsible?

387
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:48,859
Calm down, we need to do something.

388
00:36:48,884 --> 00:36:49,884
Tiéina.

389
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:52,256
Just look.

390
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,348
Damn, damn, damn! We have to get back to the ship.

391
00:36:55,373 --> 00:36:57,862
No, we cannot turn back. They are between us and the ship.

392
00:36:57,887 --> 00:37:00,497
No, that's our last position.

393
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:01,897
Dad will look for us there.

394
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:03,280
Brother, no, we can go around them.

395
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:05,235
That's a good idea, which way?

396
00:37:07,832 --> 00:37:10,242
This way, come on, everyone, follow me.

397
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:18,379
It's over, Jake.

398
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,690
Do not move.

399
00:37:29,844 --> 00:37:30,735
Is that what you caught?

400
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,099
No.

401
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:35,037
I know you always play the know-it-all, don't you?

402
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:37,228
Hands up! Hands up!

403
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:41,520
I have already killed you.

404
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,465
I guess I won't die so easily, Corporal.

405
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:52,207
No!

406
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:56,953
Help me.

407
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,683
Ah, it's you, Corporal.

408
00:38:11,154 --> 00:38:13,053
He is not a coordinator.

409
00:38:13,078 --> 00:38:15,113
They call themselves the People of Ash.

410
00:38:16,442 --> 00:38:17,871
What is that?

411
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:19,125
Did they massacre the crew?

412
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,401
Do they take the enemy's fingers as a sign of power?

413
00:38:21,514 --> 00:38:23,477
It is worse than death for her.

414
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:27,833
Do you mean the victims?

415
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:29,197
The children have disappeared.

416
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:31,466
That corresponds to an enormous amount of energy.

417
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:33,310
He therefore did not perceive the mass change.

418
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,452
He doesn't have much time left.

419
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:37,066
And that assumes that the Ash People haven't already captured him.

420
00:38:37,362 --> 00:38:38,922
We must take care of these children immediately.

421
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:40,916
Otherwise you will never see him again.

422
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:45,323
Are you following him?

423
00:38:45,348 --> 00:38:47,247
That's not our mission. So what are we doing here?

424
00:38:47,272 --> 00:38:50,562
If you follow him, we're wasting our time, Colonel.

425
00:38:50,587 --> 00:38:52,387
Boss, he's here.

426
00:38:54,086 --> 00:38:56,126
Oh, his handcuffs.

427
00:38:56,354 --> 00:38:57,354
Which way?

428
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,538
Oh, you didn't kill me. Not again.

429
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,866
Look here.

430
00:39:11,688 --> 00:39:14,103
The river should be in front of us. Let's go!

431
00:39:21,808 --> 00:39:22,891
Hello!

432
00:39:23,496 --> 00:39:26,505
No, you're stuck here. What can we do?

433
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,043
Monkey, save your air. Look at me.

434
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,205
Inhale slowly.

435
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:35,069
Look, can you wear it? Yes, I can.

436
00:39:35,108 --> 00:39:37,268
Come on, brother, make the first move.

437
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:38,293
The.

438
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,923
The child is in the water.

439
00:39:58,948 --> 00:40:00,107
Intelligent.

440
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,069
No no no!

441
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:19,266
Grandma, save him first.

442
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,831
Please.

443
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:22,509
You know his brain is dying.

444
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:23,534
Please.

445
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,520
Calm down, everything will be alright, brother.

446
00:40:27,707 --> 00:40:28,707
Inhale.

447
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,130
Links.

448
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,570
Kiri, we have to go, come on.

449
00:40:40,557 --> 00:40:42,681
Come on, we have to go.

450
00:40:42,714 --> 00:40:46,596
We can't stay here. We have to go home.

451
00:40:47,216 --> 00:40:48,715
Let's go, we have to leave.

452
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,217
Take it with you.

453
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:52,041
Left, geh.

454
00:40:58,443 --> 00:40:59,601
Halt!

455
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,132
Bring it here. Kiri, stop!

456
00:41:04,414 --> 00:41:06,573
Quickly. Stop!

457
00:41:06,718 --> 00:41:07,920
Obey my command!

458
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:14,266
Leave it here.

459
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:30,140
Stay here. Kiri, what's wrong?

460
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,594
"Exclusion"?

461
00:41:34,963 --> 00:41:36,017
"to

462
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,493
I'm not sure, but that seems to be true.

463
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:40,607
An?

464
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:43,604
Silence, I cannot speak.

465
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:58,274
Schau, schau.

466
00:42:27,706 --> 00:42:30,643
Mask, take it off.

467
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:32,667
What? He can breathe.

468
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,027
The.

469
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:25,870
Links, links, links, links.

470
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,620
Crazy, found.

471
00:44:04,193 --> 00:44:06,175
I'm sorry.

472
00:44:21,184 --> 00:44:22,292
Spider.

473
00:44:43,603 --> 00:44:44,910
Die.

474
00:44:45,914 --> 00:44:48,810
Yes, monkey, you are breathing.

475
00:44:52,285 --> 00:44:55,507
I am dead, this is the world of spirits.

476
00:44:57,373 --> 00:44:59,953
No, you're still there.

477
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:03,538
Diem.

478
00:45:03,914 --> 00:45:04,911
And.

479
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:07,383
Diem.

480
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,309
Diem.

481
00:45:09,805 --> 00:45:11,315
Diem.

482
00:45:12,514 --> 00:45:14,853
Apparently, I don't need it anymore.

483
00:45:15,926 --> 00:45:18,065
Yes, yes.

484
00:45:18,851 --> 00:45:21,471
No, calm down, please.

485
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,913
Thanks.

486
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:30,023
Thank you so much for everything you have done.

487
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,510
Damn, back again!

488
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,077
Worth it.

489
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,170
Links.

490
00:46:04,914 --> 00:46:06,053
Tsahik.

491
00:46:30,157 --> 00:46:32,573
How can he breathe without a mask?

492
00:46:33,298 --> 00:46:37,431
I can't think about it right now. We have to go back.

493
00:46:38,759 --> 00:46:44,900
Isn't our air toxic to celestial beings?

494
00:46:53,223 --> 00:46:56,812
Will you enjoy every day to the fullest?

495
00:46:58,425 --> 00:47:00,500
Because it is Eywin's will.

496
00:47:06,528 --> 00:47:07,540
Which?

497
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:09,593
And.

498
00:47:11,592 --> 00:47:17,860
Ako eggs sada zavr im, ho and the Eywa do give them spaces?

499
00:47:18,977 --> 00:47:21,980
Come on, let me go. They're going to kill him.

500
00:47:21,981 --> 00:47:23,660
Thoughts?

501
00:47:26,566 --> 00:47:33,714
No. Your goddess has no power here.

502
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:36,776
Come on. Give me the knife.

503
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:42,716
Educational.

504
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,480
From.

505
00:47:55,716 --> 00:47:58,106
Show me how it works.

506
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:08,193
Show me how to make thunder. I don't understand it.

507
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,013
Empty, no thunder. Let it thunder!

508
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:15,187
Empty. Get it running!

509
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,841
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, there's no thunder.

510
00:48:19,993 --> 00:48:21,910
Kill the younger one.

511
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:24,149
No, please don't!

512
00:48:38,217 --> 00:48:39,630
Drop the weapon.

513
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,400
Down.

514
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:46,560
Do not use weapons!

515
00:48:47,414 --> 00:48:48,623
Return to the starting point.

516
00:48:48,874 --> 00:48:49,805
Back!

517
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:51,561
The.

518
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,685
Back, back, back.

519
00:49:00,785 --> 00:49:02,581
Dad. Sully, are you all right?

520
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,397
Ready?

521
00:49:03,422 --> 00:49:04,909
Okay, kids, follow me.

522
00:49:04,934 --> 00:49:07,966
Okay, get out of here.

523
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,907
Follow me, follow me. Back!

524
00:49:26,021 --> 00:49:28,225
No, Dad!

525
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:36,654
Come on, get moving!

526
00:49:45,753 --> 00:49:48,721
No, no, Dad!

527
00:50:05,734 --> 00:50:09,873
You are strong, the man is imposing.

528
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,360
Of.

529
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,440
Show us how to create thunder.

530
00:50:23,545 --> 00:50:25,140
That's a joke.

531
00:50:30,793 --> 00:50:31,680
Do you see?

532
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:37,786
Okay, now aim! What do you want to destroy?

533
00:50:39,613 --> 00:50:41,466
Just as.

534
00:50:45,114 --> 00:50:46,161
And.

535
00:50:48,606 --> 00:50:49,896
Further.

536
00:50:55,993 --> 00:50:57,600
Isn't that great?

537
00:51:13,786 --> 00:51:15,995
I don't need you anymore, Skyman.

538
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,202
Tell him to behave! Get on your knees!

539
00:51:19,234 --> 00:51:21,512
Prepare a new one.

540
00:51:32,366 --> 00:51:33,440
Neytiri.

541
00:51:34,498 --> 00:51:35,640
Put it down.

542
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,134
Worth it.

543
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:40,995
Neytiri, we saved you. Are you alright?

544
00:51:41,028 --> 00:51:42,961
Are you okay? We saved you.

545
00:51:42,986 --> 00:51:44,785
Doctor, prepare for the operation.

546
00:51:44,824 --> 00:51:46,518
On the fourth floor.

547
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,117
They're totally crazy!

548
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,168
Come on, guys!

549
00:53:47,087 --> 00:53:48,087
The!

550
00:53:49,986 --> 00:53:51,250
Fast!

551
00:54:02,582 --> 00:54:04,069
Hey, where is the girl?

552
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,742
Come on, help her!

553
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:08,231
This way. Let's go!

554
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:11,630
The!

555
00:54:16,059 --> 00:54:17,600
I'm ready. Let's go!

556
00:54:24,797 --> 00:54:25,860
Tsahik.

557
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,680
They're already gone.

558
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,332
We will conduct an aerial search.

559
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:48,202
Slowly, slowly.

560
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,008
No no!

561
00:54:53,381 --> 00:54:54,600
My children. Neytiri.

562
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,316
My children! Calm down!

563
00:54:56,341 --> 00:54:58,140
Calm down, my children.

564
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,335
My children. Where are they?

565
00:55:02,889 --> 00:55:03,889
Where are they?

566
00:55:21,058 --> 00:55:23,176
Come on, quickly. Max, turn me on.

567
00:55:23,201 --> 00:55:24,632
Yes, yes. Are we ready?

568
00:55:24,657 --> 00:55:27,674
We're ready. Okay, let's not waste any time on calibration.

569
00:55:29,228 --> 00:55:32,127
You must rest under my supervision. Don't forget that.

570
00:55:32,152 --> 00:55:34,031
Good luck. Thank you.

571
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,504
Are there transport options?

572
00:55:38,013 --> 00:55:38,852
No.

573
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,808
Okay, let's get started.

574
00:55:50,829 --> 00:55:52,331
Excuse me.

575
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,336
That's good.

576
00:56:12,763 --> 00:56:14,921
We are certain. Yes.

577
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:20,552
Now we come to an unresolved matter.

578
00:56:25,386 --> 00:56:27,379
“To put it in,” Rose?

579
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:31,923
We still have our evening.

580
00:56:37,379 --> 00:56:38,985
Yes, I'm a little tired.

581
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:42,741
And.

582
00:56:43,893 --> 00:56:45,768
Yes, I'll save it.

583
00:56:47,507 --> 00:56:51,033
Just in case this enemy appears.

584
00:56:54,334 --> 00:56:55,826
Yes, absolutely.

585
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:08,340
You and your wife made the right decision.

586
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,436
I admit it.

587
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,143
He's a good guy.

588
00:57:13,121 --> 00:57:14,836
He's a great guy.

589
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:20,952
But that doesn't mean we'll agree.

590
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:23,512
I will continue to bring you down.

591
00:57:23,545 --> 00:57:24,384
Jake.

592
00:57:24,409 --> 00:57:25,408
If necessary.

593
00:57:28,021 --> 00:57:31,136
He still doesn't understand it.

594
00:57:32,996 --> 00:57:37,016
This world is much more complicated than you think.

595
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,039
You saw him tonight.

596
00:57:42,248 --> 00:57:43,473
With her.

597
00:57:44,644 --> 00:57:45,953
With him.

598
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:48,533
That doesn't matter.

599
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:53,618
My skin color is unimportant.

600
00:57:54,936 --> 00:57:57,951
I still know which team I'm fighting for.

601
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,811
The scene has changed, Colonel.

602
00:58:02,761 --> 00:58:05,025
Open your eyes.

603
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,096
There they are. There are the others.

604
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:29,450
Wake up. Come on, we have to keep going.

605
00:58:29,475 --> 00:58:30,397
Schnell! Schnell!

606
00:58:30,699 --> 00:58:32,397
Come on, we have to move on.

607
00:58:36,293 --> 00:58:37,048
Okay.

608
00:58:37,073 --> 00:58:39,995
You're with us! Hey!

609
00:58:44,753 --> 00:58:47,331
Jake. Hi, Sam.

610
00:58:47,363 --> 00:58:49,949
Left, rock. Just kidding, are you picking it up?

611
00:58:50,095 --> 00:58:51,889
I need your help to find us.

612
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:54,008
What was that?

613
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:57,980
Mom! Mother! Knock!

614
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,985
Right left.

615
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:01,264
Just look.

616
00:59:04,096 --> 00:59:06,873
Jake, is everything alright?

617
00:59:07,093 --> 00:59:10,090
Everything is fine. You are safe.

618
00:59:11,103 --> 00:59:12,353
Hey, Norm.

619
00:59:14,733 --> 00:59:15,978
How are you doing?

620
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,420
An wen?

621
00:59:21,777 --> 00:59:23,420
Was? Alter!

622
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:27,420
Oh yes. I have no problems breathing.

623
00:59:36,645 --> 00:59:38,046
Tuktirey.

624
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,731
Tsireya.

625
00:59:45,646 --> 00:59:49,715
Switch to real view. We are approaching the city walls.

626
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:02,955
So you think he's still Sully?

627
01:00:03,316 --> 01:00:04,454
I am sure.

628
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,507
That's not a top priority for me.

629
01:00:06,532 --> 01:00:10,674
My priority is building the city and sending Amrita to finance it.

630
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:12,949
And who do you think determines your priorities?

631
01:00:13,556 --> 01:00:16,495
Here's the big picture. Now listen carefully to the main concept.

632
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,420
How can we colonize this world if we cannot defend against its arrows?

633
01:00:20,445 --> 01:00:23,295
If you want to find this child, you have to find Sully.

634
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,409
And they're all like that.

635
01:00:25,434 --> 01:00:27,433
How many of these are left? Not many.

636
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:30,547
You already said that yesterday. Okay, here's the latest scan.

637
01:00:30,572 --> 01:00:36,319
Do you see that? That's mycelium, plain and simple. Just like the network of the forest.

638
01:00:36,344 --> 01:00:39,785
It somehow nestled in his body and spread throughout his entire organism.

639
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:42,420
And then everything was changed down to the cellular level.

640
01:00:42,445 --> 01:00:46,882
Listen, it affects the blood, the nerves, and the lungs.

641
01:00:46,907 --> 01:00:48,465
Can it be eliminated?

642
01:00:49,065 --> 01:00:50,600
No, it's an endosymbiont.

643
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:53,039
We believe they are keeping each other alive.

644
01:00:53,136 --> 01:00:55,396
If he forces himself to do it, it could kill him.

645
01:00:55,421 --> 01:00:59,420
But look, he's doing well.

646
01:01:00,005 --> 01:01:01,562
That's a good thing.

647
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:03,269
Good this way?

648
01:01:06,432 --> 01:01:09,573
What if the East German laboratories succeeded in reproducing this phenomenon?

649
01:01:09,598 --> 01:01:13,383
What if all the inhabitants of Earth could live here without masks?

650
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:18,645
Jake, there's something else.

651
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:20,441
Sit down. Hey, kid.

652
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,240
Okay.

653
01:01:23,265 --> 01:01:26,165
Silence. Silence. Everything is alright.

654
01:01:27,213 --> 01:01:29,726
Look. What's happening there?

655
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,836
What's going on? His penis is getting bigger.

656
01:01:33,313 --> 01:01:35,504
Okay. Okay? Yes.

657
01:01:50,376 --> 01:01:54,420
Grandma. Are you there?

658
01:01:54,808 --> 01:01:58,417
Please listen to my quiet voice.

659
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:04,420
I prayed in the forest that my friend would be saved.

660
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:11,420
I prayed with all my might, but you did not come.

661
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:16,420
You didn't reply, so I had to reply myself.

662
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:21,420
I don't know how, I asked my wife for help.

663
01:02:21,758 --> 01:02:23,900
I don't remember how anymore.

664
01:02:26,314 --> 01:02:29,420
Please don't. Don't leave me.

665
01:02:29,963 --> 01:02:31,904
Why am I like this?

666
01:02:32,784 --> 01:02:34,729
Why do I do these things?

667
01:02:35,177 --> 01:02:37,276
Please talk to me.

668
01:02:37,617 --> 01:02:39,003
Please.

669
01:02:40,062 --> 01:02:42,420
No, please don't.

670
01:02:42,894 --> 01:02:46,893
No no no!

671
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,119
Links.

672
01:03:04,144 --> 01:03:07,494
Eywa never came to visit me. I told you so.

673
01:03:08,007 --> 01:03:09,894
I don't know how I managed that.

674
01:03:10,193 --> 01:03:10,986
Drink something.

675
01:03:11,534 --> 01:03:12,439
Links.

676
01:03:13,733 --> 01:03:17,420
My child, you were touched by the hand of the old mother.

677
01:03:18,287 --> 01:03:22,286
We've known it since you were born.

678
01:03:29,964 --> 01:03:32,420
You're hiding something.

679
01:03:32,613 --> 01:03:35,327
I've felt it my whole life.

680
01:03:35,352 --> 01:03:37,396
Just tell the truth.

681
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:39,639
Please.

682
01:03:40,787 --> 01:03:42,287
Tell him.

683
01:03:44,633 --> 01:03:46,462
It's time.

684
01:03:48,175 --> 01:03:55,965
My child, you have no father, Kiri.

685
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:58,746
What? Where?

686
01:03:58,898 --> 01:04:01,676
Your mother. The embodiment of grace.

687
01:04:02,263 --> 01:04:05,310
At the time of your conception, Norm performed a series of tests.

688
01:04:05,335 --> 01:04:08,420
There was a pathogenic birth canal.

689
01:04:08,816 --> 01:04:11,420
You are genetically identical to this avatar.

690
01:04:11,822 --> 01:04:14,428
He has no real father.

691
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:19,239
I'm a clone, Grandma.

692
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,460
This is Eywa's will.

693
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,681
As the dreamer's body rested in the arms of the Great Mother,

694
01:04:31,896 --> 01:04:34,778
The seed has been sown.

695
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:49,140
That really hurts.

696
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:52,616
It intensifies my pain. It's bizarre.

697
01:04:52,641 --> 01:04:55,214
No, granddaughter.

698
01:04:55,239 --> 01:04:58,832
You are Eywa's child.

699
01:05:04,963 --> 01:05:07,014
I don't care what happens.

700
01:05:08,297 --> 01:05:10,263
You will always be my granddaughter.

701
01:05:11,069 --> 01:05:13,627
I am the only father you need.

702
01:05:18,493 --> 01:05:20,790
If I am so special,

703
01:05:22,063 --> 01:05:24,846
Why did Eywa cover my ears?

704
01:05:27,481 --> 01:05:31,014
We don't know why, but you don't have access to it.

705
01:05:31,046 --> 01:05:32,222
A kind of protective wall.

706
01:05:32,247 --> 01:05:33,766
Like an encryption.

707
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:36,790
The more you try to penetrate, the more resistance she offers.

708
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:42,420
Eywa has a way for you, even if she hides it.

709
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:45,190
You have to trust her.

710
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,056
I need to find out.

711
01:05:47,081 --> 01:05:49,831
No, you need to stop asking questions.

712
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:56,420
Kiri, if you try to re-establish the connection, you could die.

713
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:59,285
If you do that underwater, you will definitely die.

714
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:10,928
You can't stay here. If they already have it, we can't stop them.

715
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:18,794
If she is so dangerous for those who have everything, we must kill her.

716
01:06:22,777 --> 01:06:24,420
I am a spider.

717
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:28,086
On the beach it's us.

718
01:06:28,493 --> 01:06:31,246
We can protect it there.

719
01:06:31,813 --> 01:06:34,986
Don't look back. Don't dwell on the past.

720
01:06:35,677 --> 01:06:38,420
Come on, honey. She didn't mean it like that.

721
01:06:38,734 --> 01:06:40,574
It's decided.

722
01:06:52,391 --> 01:06:55,006
I'm sorry, honey. Take me there.

723
01:07:01,005 --> 01:07:02,420
Get me into position.

724
01:07:03,031 --> 01:07:05,253
Position myself near the rockets.

725
01:07:06,017 --> 01:07:07,420
It worked.

726
01:07:09,572 --> 01:07:11,425
Come on, and...

727
01:07:28,106 --> 01:07:31,106
A love photo. It's bleeding heavily.

728
01:08:06,793 --> 01:08:10,906
I know the demon ship is coming. Even bigger.

729
01:08:11,336 --> 01:08:13,601
And what about the murdered Tulkun?

730
01:08:13,626 --> 01:08:15,058
I'm really sorry, brother.

731
01:08:15,349 --> 01:08:19,584
Jake Sully, we have told the story of the young warrior.

732
01:08:19,781 --> 01:08:22,883
Tulkun convened a council to decide for him.

733
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:26,876
You need to rest.

734
01:08:27,539 --> 01:08:30,184
This barrier must be removed. Find me.

735
01:08:30,346 --> 01:08:32,511
Children, follow me.

736
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:46,795
No, I'm serious. When he's big enough, I'll have my own strength.

737
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:49,758
Skxawng (idiot). You need some strength first.

738
01:08:49,873 --> 01:08:54,229
Just you wait. I'll get my skin... and then I'll be there.

739
01:08:54,254 --> 01:08:56,054
So, how's it going?

740
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,975
Your daughter, the daughter of shed blood…

741
01:09:01,192 --> 01:09:03,092
Without training.

742
01:09:03,421 --> 01:09:04,584
Halt!

743
01:09:05,322 --> 01:09:08,667
She achieved what Tsahik could not.

744
01:09:08,933 --> 01:09:11,557
Who are you to dare question Eywa's will?

745
01:09:11,582 --> 01:09:14,874
I am Tsahik. So act like Tsahik.

746
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,911
This potion is useless.

747
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,698
The potion from my forest heals faster.

748
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:23,488
I told you to rest. Don't rest.

749
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:26,420
Then it's my glass's fault.

750
01:09:27,014 --> 01:09:28,305
Oh, look.

751
01:09:30,829 --> 01:09:33,602
Stupid woman. Tsahik witch.

752
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:37,383
Or maybe I forgot that you're pregnant.

753
01:09:57,156 --> 01:09:58,817
Metkayina spoke.

754
01:09:58,842 --> 01:10:03,122
She claims the outcast continues to resist the Tulkun Way.

755
01:10:03,764 --> 01:10:05,750
Murder is forbidden.

756
01:10:05,775 --> 01:10:07,491
He was excommunicated for that reason.

757
01:10:07,923 --> 01:10:10,050
But he did it again.

758
01:10:10,264 --> 01:10:15,428
The outcasts attacked the demon ship, bringing death and destruction to our people.

759
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:18,383
Čak und Sinu Toruk Maktoa.

760
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:22,350
Dad… they killed him… I know.

761
01:10:28,499 --> 01:10:32,001
She claims he continues to cause chaos.

762
01:10:32,367 --> 01:10:35,708
He spreads bad ideas among our young people.

763
01:10:37,361 --> 01:10:38,814
Absurd. That's not true.

764
01:10:38,839 --> 01:10:42,064
She says he will only bring more death.

765
01:10:42,593 --> 01:10:44,749
Hey, why aren't you talking?

766
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:46,774
Say something!

767
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:56,750
She says an outcast shouldn't live in these waters. No.

768
01:10:56,782 --> 01:11:00,754
He must go far away where his song cannot be heard.

769
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:02,798
Life imprisonment.

770
01:11:04,605 --> 01:11:05,858
That's not fair.

771
01:11:08,112 --> 01:11:09,666
It's up to you.

772
01:11:10,331 --> 01:11:13,790
You will never hear my song again.

773
01:11:14,745 --> 01:11:16,928
Nein, Payakan...

774
01:11:17,923 --> 01:11:20,420
My brother! Please don't do that!

775
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:23,078
Payakan, Bengel!

776
01:11:29,474 --> 01:11:32,820
That... that's wrong! That's wrong!

777
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,945
He is not allowed to speak here.

778
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:38,123
No, Payakan fought for us. He fought for us.

779
01:11:38,148 --> 01:11:40,720
He saved your daughter's life. He saved her life.

780
01:11:40,745 --> 01:11:42,040
He is not allowed to speak here.

781
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:44,396
He defended us. Here is the council.

782
01:11:44,421 --> 01:11:45,459
Everyone has already spoken.

783
01:11:45,484 --> 01:11:48,596
The Tulkuns are hunted. They die.

784
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,998
Man, that's enough! No!

785
01:11:51,023 --> 01:11:53,695
Lo'ak is telling the truth. No!

786
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,420
Payakan je ratnik.

787
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:57,645
He fought for us. More than you did.

788
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:00,299
More than you. More than anyone else.

789
01:12:00,324 --> 01:12:02,740
He fought for us! Sit down! Watch!

790
01:12:02,858 --> 01:12:04,683
Get him out of here!

791
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:05,859
Worth it.

792
01:12:05,884 --> 01:12:07,141
Listen to him.

793
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:09,165
We are on the city council.

794
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:11,970
"Exclusion"?

795
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:14,934
He never defends me.

796
01:12:14,966 --> 01:12:15,966
Please sit down.

797
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:20,420
The council continues its work.

798
01:12:22,688 --> 01:12:25,253
We are at war. Do you understand?

799
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:28,724
If you break the commandments, people will die.

800
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:32,211
We're hiding here. We're trying to remain invisible.

801
01:12:32,236 --> 01:12:35,224
But he is here and he is inspiring the youth.

802
01:12:35,249 --> 01:12:37,892
A catastrophe will overwhelm us.

803
01:12:38,433 --> 01:12:41,333
You want him to leave? That's why you stayed silent.

804
01:12:41,358 --> 01:12:43,992
He's uncontrollable. Just like you.

805
01:12:44,017 --> 01:12:46,055
If you had addressed the problem from the beginning,

806
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,079
that you broke the commandments when your brother was still weak…

807
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,940
It's not my fault!

808
01:12:57,226 --> 01:12:58,926
That means...

809
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:02,420
It's not my fault!

810
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,601
Look!

811
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,307
Go to him, Jake.

812
01:13:29,847 --> 01:13:32,420
Otherwise you'll lose another son.

813
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:37,948
I have nothing to say to him.

814
01:13:40,008 --> 01:13:41,934
Don't blame Lo'ak.

815
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:46,795
You said you could protect this family.

816
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:49,018
You promised.

817
01:13:49,308 --> 01:13:51,419
Yes, he thought we were safe here.

818
01:13:51,445 --> 01:13:54,107
Our son is dead, Jake.

819
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:56,200
I was wrong!

820
01:13:57,970 --> 01:13:58,963
And you?

821
01:13:58,988 --> 01:14:01,598
That all my decisions for this family were wrong?

822
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,736
That I killed our son?

823
01:14:09,394 --> 01:14:14,645
And we're still here... hiding this pink skin.

824
01:14:15,615 --> 01:14:17,180
This alien.

825
01:14:17,445 --> 01:14:21,469
If I had to choose between my family and my pink skin,

826
01:14:21,605 --> 01:14:24,109
I would kill him on the spot.

827
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:25,808
Stop. Stop. Stop.

828
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:28,625
You can't be like that. You can't be like that.

829
01:14:29,105 --> 01:14:33,098
You've already chosen between your family and your pink skin. Do you remember?

830
01:14:33,123 --> 01:14:34,123
Are you coming down?

831
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:41,195
You can't live like that, baby.

832
01:14:41,269 --> 01:14:43,375
Full of hate.

833
01:14:44,343 --> 01:14:46,465
I hate her, Jake.

834
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:48,160
I hate them.

835
01:14:49,171 --> 01:14:53,149
I hate her. I hate her little pink hands.

836
01:14:53,737 --> 01:14:57,255
I hate the madness that reigns in their minds.

837
01:14:59,626 --> 01:15:01,318
I am a human being.

838
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:03,051
From the inside.

839
01:15:03,076 --> 01:15:05,237
Do you hate me?

840
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:09,178
I will always remain a stranger to you, won't I?

841
01:15:09,556 --> 01:15:12,365
No matter how long I live in her place.

842
01:15:13,723 --> 01:15:15,441
Do you hate your children?

843
01:15:17,276 --> 01:15:19,873
With strangers' hands?

844
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:21,723
No.

845
01:15:22,535 --> 01:15:24,291
Are you ashamed?

846
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:28,239
Every time they make a mistake, they are different.

847
01:15:29,234 --> 01:15:32,918
That's because of her human side, isn't it?

848
01:15:54,582 --> 01:15:56,307
I'm sorry, honey.

849
01:15:56,857 --> 01:15:58,502
I'm sorry.

850
01:15:59,067 --> 01:16:00,795
I'm sorry.

851
01:16:03,509 --> 01:16:07,282
I have to... I'm going to stay strong now.

852
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:11,148
This family is our fortress.

853
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:36,630
It is said that when you touch steel,

854
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:39,795
The poison seeps into the heart.

855
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:06,411
Look!

856
01:17:07,103 --> 01:17:09,742
Brother. Look!

857
01:17:14,373 --> 01:17:17,244
Stay alive, my brother.

858
01:17:18,976 --> 01:17:21,723
We need you. We love you.

859
01:17:22,061 --> 01:17:24,724
Great things lie within you.

860
01:17:39,744 --> 01:17:43,452
The power of the ancestors is here.

861
01:17:47,173 --> 01:17:49,983
Everything can change.

862
01:18:02,269 --> 01:18:03,562
That's it!

863
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,035
That's good.

864
01:18:17,146 --> 01:18:18,695
May Mactu.

865
01:18:25,109 --> 01:18:26,534
Wow.

866
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:32,121
That's it.

867
01:18:36,638 --> 01:18:39,052
Can you feel it? Yes.

868
01:18:39,154 --> 01:18:41,308
The High Priest.

869
01:18:41,629 --> 01:18:43,338
Yes, exactly.

870
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:45,888
Advertising!

871
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,848
Go on, do it now!

872
01:19:11,421 --> 01:19:14,241
They're calling him!

873
01:19:16,663 --> 01:19:18,679
Get them done!

874
01:19:18,914 --> 01:19:21,293
I think it's important to talk about this, Colonel. You know nothing about it.

875
01:19:21,318 --> 01:19:23,275
Yes, they know.

876
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:25,255
They simply don't talk to each other.

877
01:19:26,313 --> 01:19:28,178
We have one last move,

878
01:19:28,422 --> 01:19:30,225
But it is very risky.

879
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,778
Hey, do you remember me? Look at this.

880
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:18,686
Hey, hey, calm down.

881
01:20:18,711 --> 01:20:20,615
Pick it up.

882
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,358
I brought something for Tsahik.

883
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:25,310
Take me to Tsahik.

884
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:27,152
Hey, hey.

885
01:20:27,441 --> 01:20:31,208
It doesn't have to be this way. I'm watching you, Tak'uk.

886
01:20:49,272 --> 01:20:50,949
Tsahik.

887
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:57,232
Tsahik?

888
01:21:13,726 --> 01:21:16,231
I can give you as much as you want.

889
01:21:26,999 --> 01:21:29,738
What is your name? Heavenly Man.

890
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:31,618
Quaritch.

891
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,721
Oberst Miles Quaritch.

892
01:21:39,643 --> 01:21:42,230
If you touch me with that thing again, I'll kill you.

893
01:21:42,372 --> 01:21:45,213
You shall not kill anyone.

894
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,858
I am ready to prove you wrong.

895
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:51,792
It's nothing.

896
01:22:15,059 --> 01:22:16,585
Good tip.

897
01:22:18,186 --> 01:22:19,929
Quaritch.

898
01:22:20,856 --> 01:22:22,612
Your next victim.

899
01:22:22,769 --> 01:22:25,719
Think carefully about what you want to do.

900
01:22:28,117 --> 01:22:29,753
Go.

901
01:22:30,663 --> 01:22:32,696
We'll talk inside.

902
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,147
"Being discarded," "efe?"

903
01:22:53,732 --> 01:22:54,888
Hm.

904
01:22:57,673 --> 01:22:58,907
Comfortable.

905
01:23:01,419 --> 01:23:03,545
The problem is that

906
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:06,902
They're all lying to me.

907
01:23:13,442 --> 01:23:15,410
Subscription

908
01:23:15,665 --> 01:23:19,014
that you can make a stone tell the truth.

909
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:20,364
The road to Ōvjeka.

910
01:23:20,433 --> 01:23:22,907
Another divine human being like you.

911
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:25,280
He's not like me.

912
01:23:25,954 --> 01:23:27,953
He is now a traitor.

913
01:23:28,890 --> 01:23:30,736
Then he must die.

914
01:23:32,737 --> 01:23:35,797
But I can help you find this man.

915
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:39,345
And the others you are looking for.

916
01:23:40,935 --> 01:23:44,776
This man.

917
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:53,386
First, I must see your soul.

918
01:23:53,968 --> 01:23:55,680
Stay calm.

919
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:58,713
Stay calm.

920
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:23,420
It is very powerful.

921
01:24:58,588 --> 01:25:00,178
It is …

922
01:25:01,357 --> 01:25:04,659
The only pure thing in the world.

923
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:11,749
When I was little, fire came down from the mountain.

924
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,827
Burn the forest down.

925
01:25:16,703 --> 01:25:18,840
I destroyed everything.

926
01:25:23,063 --> 01:25:26,562
My people were starving.

927
01:25:26,767 --> 01:25:29,889
They screamed for help.

928
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:35,027
Ali Eywa is not a doctor.

929
01:25:36,817 --> 01:25:40,863
That's why I went close to the fire.

930
01:25:43,109 --> 01:25:46,781
And I learned his method.

931
01:25:51,424 --> 01:25:54,983
I mastered fire.

932
01:25:56,477 --> 01:26:01,341
But when my people acted,

933
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:04,489
We did not surrender and we did not die.

934
01:26:04,528 --> 01:26:08,527
The same person who was born in Eywa.

935
01:26:09,817 --> 01:26:12,767
We left Eywa.

936
01:26:14,345 --> 01:26:16,420
Weak mother.

937
01:26:17,111 --> 01:26:19,420
For fragile children.

938
01:26:21,483 --> 01:26:27,420
We do not feed on evil souls.

939
01:26:31,362 --> 01:26:33,122
...

940
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:40,355
Only true words come from your mouth.

941
01:26:46,081 --> 01:26:48,508
He has a strong heart.

942
01:26:48,644 --> 01:26:50,882
Without fear.

943
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:55,686
That's great.

944
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:59,108
Unit and te, Quaritch.

945
01:27:04,073 --> 01:27:08,167
But first you have to answer me.

946
01:27:11,197 --> 01:27:14,070
Why are you here?

947
01:27:18,176 --> 01:27:19,804
I'm here because of you.

948
01:27:21,353 --> 01:27:23,750
You want to serve me.

949
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:27,253
I serve no one.

950
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:30,567
Be with me.

951
01:27:31,131 --> 01:27:33,704
But I don't need you.

952
01:27:34,305 --> 01:27:40,833
Perhaps I will make you my slave to satisfy my desires.

953
01:27:41,318 --> 01:27:44,714
It sounds like a nice weekend, but…

954
01:27:45,129 --> 01:27:47,591
It's not what you really want.

955
01:27:47,753 --> 01:27:50,233
What and where?

956
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,995
Something you've never had before.

957
01:27:55,453 --> 01:27:57,570
Someone who is your equal.

958
01:28:00,783 --> 01:28:04,675
You want to create chaos in the world.

959
01:28:06,426 --> 01:28:08,346
I'll give you weapons.

960
01:28:08,756 --> 01:28:10,433
I'll give you ammunition.

961
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:12,239
RPG.

962
01:28:12,717 --> 01:28:14,993
Much stronger.

963
01:28:15,592 --> 01:28:17,684
Remote control.

964
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,889
It strikes with lightning speed.

965
01:28:20,786 --> 01:28:22,386
Tribes.

966
01:28:22,911 --> 01:28:25,201
As long as you can fly.

967
01:28:26,388 --> 01:28:29,213
One does not have to submit to the masters.

968
01:28:34,799 --> 01:28:37,467
Do you want to challenge someone?

969
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:40,880
Trebaño me.

970
01:28:45,543 --> 01:28:47,112
I see you.

971
01:28:48,789 --> 01:28:51,129
Exactly.

972
01:30:09,563 --> 01:30:13,114
If I can make contact again one day,

973
01:30:13,983 --> 01:30:18,558
I can guide you into the spiritual world.

974
01:30:19,635 --> 01:30:22,377
Okay, can I go now?

975
01:30:22,567 --> 01:30:25,068
No, not with me.

976
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:28,219
This stranger can't just appear out of nowhere.

977
01:30:28,526 --> 01:30:31,326
To frighten the ancestors.

978
01:30:40,746 --> 01:30:44,836
We begin to gather for the Tulkun children's ceremony.

979
01:30:46,563 --> 01:30:50,660
The young Tulkun and a baby are drifting together.

980
01:30:50,661 --> 01:30:54,750
Your first contact with Hel will be wonderful.

981
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:23,404
Let's see.

982
01:31:25,404 --> 01:31:26,861
Okay.

983
01:31:27,133 --> 01:31:28,933
I'll set that up for you.

984
01:31:29,074 --> 01:31:30,276
Come to the festival.

985
01:31:30,301 --> 01:31:32,019
No no no.

986
01:31:32,807 --> 01:31:35,667
Then I'll stay here with you.

987
01:31:42,752 --> 01:31:46,042
Listen, I shouldn't really tell you this, but…

988
01:31:46,597 --> 01:31:50,780
My Tulkun sister says they heard Payakan's voice.

989
01:31:50,781 --> 01:31:53,380
In a very weak voice, he calls for his clan of origin.

990
01:31:53,381 --> 01:31:54,381
Where?

991
01:31:55,364 --> 01:31:58,737
The song of the Tulkun carries far across the water, Lo'ak.

992
01:31:58,762 --> 01:31:59,783
Please!

993
01:32:29,834 --> 01:32:31,093
Lo'ak.

994
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:36,867
My mother.

995
01:32:37,898 --> 01:32:39,572
Where are you going?

996
01:32:41,299 --> 01:32:42,676
Just a little bit outside.

997
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,722
I have something to do.

998
01:32:54,544 --> 01:32:55,950
Lo'ak.

999
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:59,060
Lo'ak.

1000
01:33:01,133 --> 01:33:02,535
Lo'ak, cage.

1001
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:05,766
Lo'ak.

1002
01:33:11,862 --> 01:33:16,679
Yes, we need to find Brother Payakana.

1003
01:33:22,177 --> 01:33:23,534
Mo�emo po�eti.

1004
01:33:23,559 --> 01:33:25,116
Our ceremony will take place in five days.

1005
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:26,580
I have to go.

1006
01:33:26,605 --> 01:33:28,022
It's my fault.

1007
01:33:28,047 --> 01:33:29,047
Let's go.

1008
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:31,520
Everyone is leaving.

1009
01:33:32,636 --> 01:33:34,340
They too.

1010
01:33:34,341 --> 01:33:36,041
Don't tell anyone.

1011
01:33:43,025 --> 01:33:45,819
Our children set out to look for him.

1012
01:33:45,844 --> 01:33:47,274
She let them go.

1013
01:33:47,299 --> 01:33:49,240
They did not ask for permission.

1014
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,713
I will send hunters there.

1015
01:33:51,821 --> 01:33:53,460
We cannot search the entire ocean.

1016
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,700
We need warriors here in case the demon ships arrive.

1017
01:33:55,725 --> 01:33:57,536
For the ceremony.

1018
01:33:57,674 --> 01:34:00,410
My son is over there, all alone.

1019
01:34:00,886 --> 01:34:04,044
He will come back when he is ready.

1020
01:34:04,668 --> 01:34:06,575
That's just how he is.

1021
01:34:10,968 --> 01:34:13,243
Look what he's doing.

1022
01:34:14,396 --> 01:34:18,427
Jake, the strength of your ancestors flows in your son's veins.

1023
01:34:19,566 --> 01:34:21,498
You have to believe it.

1024
01:34:27,525 --> 01:34:28,872
There is no water.

1025
01:34:28,911 --> 01:34:30,230
That makes no sense.

1026
01:34:32,538 --> 01:34:36,023
Nobody can see your house.

1027
01:34:40,687 --> 01:34:43,143
Before you were born.

1028
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:48,903
So.

1029
01:34:48,938 --> 01:34:50,020
Until death.

1030
01:35:12,917 --> 01:35:19,380
How many birds are there in the sea if the one named Toruk Makto lives?

1031
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:22,060
One, two… how many birds are there in the sky?

1032
01:35:22,085 --> 01:35:24,103
One two three four...

1033
01:35:24,884 --> 01:35:28,034
Couldn't you have asked Eywa to make you a little taller?

1034
01:35:28,059 --> 01:35:29,598
Maybe you could have been a little bluer.

1035
01:35:29,623 --> 01:35:33,319
No, I was busy saving your life.

1036
01:35:33,344 --> 01:35:34,242
Skxawng (stupid).

1037
01:35:34,267 --> 01:35:37,136
Just a little bit, a few centimeters.

1038
01:35:39,122 --> 01:35:41,583
She is the Great Mother, she can do everything.

1039
01:35:43,973 --> 01:35:47,489
You are perfect, just the way you are.

1040
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:09,367
Come on, monkey.

1041
01:36:12,179 --> 01:36:14,905
Next, I'll learn to fly a skimwing.

1042
01:36:15,433 --> 01:36:19,158
May you be a mighty warrior and protect us all.

1043
01:36:19,183 --> 01:36:21,087
Is it due to height or curls?

1044
01:36:21,112 --> 01:36:23,182
Or by the size of the curls?

1045
01:36:23,941 --> 01:36:25,280
What is it?

1046
01:36:32,617 --> 01:36:34,917
Go, run!

1047
01:36:43,875 --> 01:36:45,402
Fast!

1048
01:36:48,231 --> 01:36:50,007
Come on, you Idiot!

1049
01:36:52,035 --> 01:36:54,542
Come on, hurry up!

1050
01:36:55,081 --> 01:36:57,018
Hey, look!

1051
01:36:58,494 --> 01:36:59,951
Do you want to try it?

1052
01:37:00,551 --> 01:37:02,910
Is that all you can do?

1053
01:37:03,719 --> 01:37:04,719
Damned!

1054
01:37:07,761 --> 01:37:10,103
Where are you going, man?

1055
01:37:10,128 --> 01:37:12,957
Be careful, this is dangerous, you could hurt someone.

1056
01:37:14,627 --> 01:37:16,339
Hey you!

1057
01:37:31,601 --> 01:37:32,720
Let's go!

1058
01:37:32,934 --> 01:37:34,215
Spread!

1059
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:37,720
Libellus, brother, you are a fool.

1060
01:37:53,192 --> 01:37:54,738
That's a joke.

1061
01:38:02,532 --> 01:38:05,082
They surround us, the weapons are burning, get your weapons ready!

1062
01:38:05,114 --> 01:38:07,324
Where is your brother? He went to get water.

1063
01:38:07,349 --> 01:38:09,212
Where is Kiri? Where is Spider?

1064
01:38:11,699 --> 01:38:13,898
Dad! Where's Spider?

1065
01:38:13,923 --> 01:38:17,153
They took him away, this colonel in blue took him away.

1066
01:38:30,112 --> 01:38:31,180
Take him with you!

1067
01:38:52,754 --> 01:38:54,080
Calm down.

1068
01:38:54,148 --> 01:38:55,528
Navigate.

1069
01:38:56,455 --> 01:38:57,595
Navigate.

1070
01:39:05,489 --> 01:39:07,360
Jake Sully!

1071
01:39:08,541 --> 01:39:10,460
Change girls and get out of here now.

1072
01:39:10,461 --> 01:39:11,917
We won't leave without you.

1073
01:39:11,942 --> 01:39:14,558
Well, they have Spider, they're holding him there.

1074
01:39:14,583 --> 01:39:16,251
You have seen what I am capable of.

1075
01:39:16,768 --> 01:39:18,607
These people will die.

1076
01:39:18,651 --> 01:39:20,650
You shouldn't ask that.

1077
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:22,773
But I have to.

1078
01:39:24,193 --> 01:39:25,626
It's the only way.

1079
01:39:26,387 --> 01:39:28,187
Jake Sully!

1080
01:39:28,381 --> 01:39:30,220
I'm going crazy!

1081
01:39:30,221 --> 01:39:32,220
You must leave immediately.

1082
01:39:32,245 --> 01:39:34,895
Grab your sister, run and hide.

1083
01:39:35,054 --> 01:39:36,054
Fast.

1084
01:39:37,985 --> 01:39:39,420
If you stay, I'll stay too.

1085
01:39:39,470 --> 01:39:41,020
I will kill many of them.

1086
01:39:41,021 --> 01:39:43,524
Whatever happens, don't raise the weapon.

1087
01:39:43,549 --> 01:39:45,083
Swear to me.

1088
01:39:47,754 --> 01:39:49,473
I know he's here.

1089
01:39:49,498 --> 01:39:51,077
I'll take care of it.

1090
01:39:51,102 --> 01:39:52,509
He is dressed.

1091
01:39:52,534 --> 01:39:56,417
He belongs to us.

1092
01:39:56,442 --> 01:39:58,081
Something is burning.

1093
01:39:58,106 --> 01:39:59,013
Enter sector four.

1094
01:39:59,038 --> 01:40:01,277
Throw a Molotov cocktail into the middle of the village.

1095
01:40:01,302 --> 01:40:03,461
Understood, let's continue with the Molotov cocktails.

1096
01:40:18,767 --> 01:40:21,800
I want Jake Sully!

1097
01:40:21,801 --> 01:40:23,860
Stop, stop, don't shoot!

1098
01:40:23,861 --> 01:40:25,000
Stop firing!

1099
01:40:25,001 --> 01:40:26,436
Halt!

1100
01:40:26,534 --> 01:40:27,534
Stop firing!

1101
01:40:28,787 --> 01:40:30,500
Ready, back.

1102
01:40:32,433 --> 01:40:34,680
That's right, brother.

1103
01:40:51,423 --> 01:40:52,533
Colonel?

1104
01:40:53,414 --> 01:40:54,860
Kaplare.

1105
01:40:55,506 --> 01:40:58,685
Take me away, let my family go, let them live in peace.

1106
01:40:59,017 --> 01:41:00,433
That is not enough.

1107
01:41:00,707 --> 01:41:02,665
The mission must also be aborted.

1108
01:41:06,771 --> 01:41:08,305
To me, zadrúava.

1109
01:41:08,578 --> 01:41:11,611
You two are very dangerous here.

1110
01:41:12,111 --> 01:41:14,144
Pregnant women, children.

1111
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:19,164
I blew up my grandmother's cabin because I don't care.

1112
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:22,848
My friends here can't wait to kill them all.

1113
01:41:22,873 --> 01:41:24,901
and to take several prisoners.

1114
01:41:40,951 --> 01:41:42,208
Really?

1115
01:41:43,036 --> 01:41:44,543
Are we really doing that?

1116
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:48,758
If I lower my hand, you and your new love will die.

1117
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:50,761
You will be the first to die.

1118
01:41:50,786 --> 01:41:53,428
If I die, everyone here dies.

1119
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:54,539
Mud.

1120
01:41:55,324 --> 01:41:57,820
You can kill some of them, but not all of them.

1121
01:41:57,845 --> 01:42:02,238
We will attack, and your ships will hesitate, for our faces are alike.

1122
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,428
And while you are begging for your life,

1123
01:42:06,941 --> 01:42:08,704
I will finish you off.

1124
01:42:09,687 --> 01:42:11,480
Vau, Kaplare.

1125
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,976
I don't know if you're intelligent or crazy.

1126
01:42:15,001 --> 01:42:17,401
I never would have thought you were intelligent.

1127
01:42:18,275 --> 01:42:21,020
I need your promise, from Marine to Marine.

1128
01:42:21,170 --> 01:42:24,123
Safety for these people.

1129
01:42:24,834 --> 01:42:27,364
Burn them all, Quaritch!

1130
01:42:35,883 --> 01:42:37,623
Have we reached an agreement?

1131
01:42:42,054 --> 01:42:43,139
We have reached an agreement.

1132
01:42:44,416 --> 01:42:46,344
Do you want to swear in your own way?

1133
01:42:55,401 --> 01:42:56,798
Take him away!

1134
01:42:57,973 --> 01:42:59,413
Turn around.

1135
01:43:04,599 --> 01:43:05,801
The!

1136
01:43:24,174 --> 01:43:25,880
Go, quickly.

1137
01:43:26,230 --> 01:43:27,880
Drugi put, Göo. Sully.

1138
01:43:27,881 --> 01:43:28,949
Haha.

1139
01:43:32,565 --> 01:43:33,833
Good luck.

1140
01:44:15,793 --> 01:44:16,914
Who are we talking to?

1141
01:44:16,939 --> 01:44:18,302
Ma'am, a big attack.

1142
01:44:18,327 --> 01:44:19,526
The riders of the Banshee are approaching.

1143
01:44:19,551 --> 01:44:20,992
I see them, line up.

1144
01:44:21,017 --> 01:44:22,745
I can't, madam, the weapon is locked.

1145
01:44:22,770 --> 01:44:25,039
They all bear the IFM marking.

1146
01:44:25,925 --> 01:44:26,413
Proïiri.

1147
01:44:26,438 --> 01:44:28,012
416, 7. Meta.

1148
01:44:29,845 --> 01:44:31,705
TRANSPONDER DETECTED

1149
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:07,666
Stand up straight, you idiot!

1150
01:45:08,094 --> 01:45:10,094
Don't show fear!

1151
01:45:17,140 --> 00:00:00,000
Worth it.

1152
01:45:19,790 --> 01:45:20,948
It's over, go away!

1153
01:45:22,502 --> 01:45:23,642
Jake!

1154
01:45:23,861 --> 01:45:24,902
Let's go. Quick!

1155
01:45:25,141 --> 01:45:26,408
Jake!

1156
01:45:26,761 --> 01:45:27,761
Jake!

1157
01:45:30,974 --> 01:45:31,860
Jake!

1158
01:45:49,194 --> 01:45:51,533
Mission accomplished, General.

1159
01:45:51,558 --> 01:45:54,517
Jake Sully, Toruk Makto personally.

1160
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:12,720
Distributing weapons is not enough.

1161
01:46:12,745 --> 01:46:15,785
You have allowed the enemy into this area.

1162
01:46:15,794 --> 01:46:16,513
Weapons later.

1163
01:46:16,537 --> 01:46:17,940
No chance.

1164
01:46:17,941 --> 01:46:20,300
Not an enemy, but an ally.

1165
01:46:21,311 --> 01:46:25,836
General Artmore, allow me to introduce you to Varang, Tsahik of Mangkwana.

1166
01:46:29,127 --> 01:46:32,060
To be perfectly clear, Colonel Quaritch.

1167
01:46:32,061 --> 01:46:34,460
I want all these savages eliminated immediately.

1168
01:46:34,461 --> 01:46:38,980
From my base, including your girl.

1169
01:46:45,626 --> 01:46:48,174
Don't be an idiot, General.

1170
01:46:49,357 --> 01:46:51,101
Accept this victory.

1171
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:54,791
We did it, guys!

1172
01:46:57,961 --> 01:47:00,012
Everyone is here!

1173
01:47:18,125 --> 01:47:19,218
Are you sure?

1174
01:47:40,410 --> 01:47:41,410
Calm down!

1175
01:47:48,710 --> 01:47:50,598
It only hurts a little.

1176
01:47:51,338 --> 01:47:52,665
Slow!

1177
01:47:55,593 --> 01:47:56,760
Keep Calm!

1178
01:47:58,615 --> 01:47:59,895
Apply slowly!

1179
01:48:04,998 --> 01:48:06,312
Understood!

1180
01:48:09,710 --> 01:48:11,037
Understood!

1181
01:48:17,594 --> 01:48:20,760
We say: "Be careful when cleaning!"

1182
01:48:20,985 --> 01:48:21,985
I understand!

1183
01:48:25,770 --> 01:48:26,888
It's Lo'ak! It's him!

1184
01:48:26,913 --> 01:48:29,009
Lo'ak! You are Lo'ak!

1185
01:48:29,034 --> 01:48:30,480
Stop! Look!

1186
01:48:30,505 --> 01:48:32,039
Lo'ak! Tsireya!

1187
01:48:36,137 --> 01:48:40,710
It is also said: "When you look down into the sea,

1188
01:48:43,434 --> 01:48:45,995
"Your soul will be judged."

1189
01:48:58,373 --> 01:49:00,290
Zeya! Hurry up!

1190
01:49:11,085 --> 01:49:12,098
I like it!

1191
01:50:16,329 --> 01:50:17,655
Look!

1192
01:50:17,783 --> 01:50:18,529
Look!

1193
01:50:18,655 --> 01:50:19,649
Look!

1194
01:50:19,773 --> 01:50:20,773
Look!

1195
01:50:25,467 --> 01:50:26,480
Tsireya.

1196
01:50:31,834 --> 01:50:33,345
Thank you, Grandma.

1197
01:50:34,494 --> 01:50:35,493
Let him breathe.

1198
01:50:35,548 --> 01:50:36,387
Let go!

1199
01:50:40,970 --> 01:50:42,943
You all came because of me.

1200
01:50:43,821 --> 01:50:45,820
My friend is my neighbor.

1201
01:50:50,071 --> 01:50:51,961
Is that your sister? Yes.

1202
01:50:52,953 --> 01:50:55,077
What about Payakan? Did he hear it?

1203
01:50:55,102 --> 01:50:57,465
It's near. It's coming.

1204
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,879
So, what did you find?

1205
01:51:06,588 --> 01:51:09,108
It is the mycelium that lives inside his body.

1206
01:51:09,141 --> 01:51:10,790
Wait, is there something living in there?

1207
01:51:10,815 --> 01:51:12,454
Yes, it is an endosymbiont.

1208
01:51:12,479 --> 01:51:14,029
I don't regulate ions. Exchange.

1209
01:51:14,054 --> 01:51:14,782
Hey, stop it!

1210
01:51:14,807 --> 01:51:16,229
I don't need to know how it works.

1211
01:51:16,254 --> 01:51:18,571
I just need to know if it's reproducible.

1212
01:51:24,646 --> 01:51:27,040
Hey, you bastard!

1213
01:51:30,263 --> 01:51:33,890
I told that idiot with the gloves to stay away from me. You.

1214
01:51:33,915 --> 01:51:35,343
Where is Jake?

1215
01:51:35,996 --> 01:51:38,196
He is where he belongs.

1216
01:51:38,221 --> 01:51:38,722
Here.

1217
01:51:40,478 --> 01:51:42,092
I brought you a hamburger.

1218
01:51:42,117 --> 01:51:43,435
Don't hurt him.

1219
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:45,489
He is no longer a part of your life.

1220
01:51:46,574 --> 01:51:48,073
You are with me now.

1221
01:51:49,399 --> 01:51:50,639
I am your father.

1222
01:51:50,807 --> 01:51:52,306
My father is dead.

1223
01:51:53,269 --> 01:51:56,908
It is merely an invention, a memory he left behind.

1224
01:51:56,933 --> 01:51:58,692
No no.

1225
01:51:58,717 --> 01:52:00,166
I'm still me.

1226
01:52:00,563 --> 01:52:01,593
I checked.

1227
01:52:01,618 --> 01:52:02,954
Yes, look.

1228
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:05,660
Colonel Miles Quaritch.

1229
01:52:06,194 --> 01:52:07,554
Deceased.

1230
01:52:12,626 --> 01:52:14,458
That's why we rarely spoke to each other.

1231
01:52:14,483 --> 01:52:17,171
when we were together in the forest, but…

1232
01:52:18,236 --> 01:52:19,472
I must thank you.

1233
01:52:19,497 --> 01:52:23,632
You saved me from a sinking ship.

1234
01:52:23,853 --> 01:52:25,442
You saved my life.

1235
01:52:25,773 --> 01:52:28,590
No, you most certainly did not do that.

1236
01:52:29,890 --> 01:52:31,080
Perhaps that's true.

1237
01:52:32,312 --> 01:52:34,380
Perhaps deep down, that's not the case.

1238
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:37,680
I am definitely very grateful to you.

1239
01:52:37,717 --> 01:52:43,921
And I must say, my son, that I am proud of you.

1240
01:52:46,358 --> 01:52:47,545
You are an incredible boy.

1241
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:51,467
You are courageous, you are intelligent and...

1242
01:52:52,372 --> 01:52:54,701
He suddenly feels brave.

1243
01:52:56,031 --> 01:52:57,900
I see myself in you.

1244
01:52:57,901 --> 01:52:58,901
And.

1245
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:02,733
I really see you.

1246
01:53:03,413 --> 01:53:04,634
Just like your mother.

1247
01:53:06,486 --> 01:53:12,110
She was wild, strong, and difficult to understand.

1248
01:53:13,716 --> 01:53:15,006
I loved her.

1249
01:53:15,130 --> 01:53:18,121
I was angry because she loved you.

1250
01:53:19,990 --> 01:53:25,134
The hardest thing she did that day was to board a battleship and go to war.

1251
01:53:25,463 --> 01:53:27,653
She left her baby behind.

1252
01:53:30,073 --> 01:53:32,818
Your mother died a hero, my son.

1253
01:53:34,112 --> 01:53:36,355
It's inside you too.

1254
01:53:38,649 --> 01:53:41,516
I'm certainly not here to reminisce.

1255
01:53:41,541 --> 01:53:43,920
I just wanted to tell you that I'm here for you.

1256
01:53:45,043 --> 01:53:51,283
If you need me, I'm here for you.

1257
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,618
May I keep it?

1258
01:54:06,133 --> 01:54:08,099
You need a hiding place, don't you?

1259
01:54:18,548 --> 01:54:19,673
My brother!

1260
01:54:24,088 --> 01:54:25,741
Nice to see you.

1261
01:54:26,415 --> 01:54:28,824
I SEE YOU

1262
01:54:34,210 --> 01:54:36,137
What's going on? What happened?

1263
01:54:36,812 --> 01:54:37,818
That means...

1264
01:54:38,437 --> 01:54:40,052
Very bad.

1265
01:54:41,098 --> 01:54:43,122
Haven't you found your birth crown yet?

1266
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:44,694
And.

1267
01:54:46,221 --> 01:54:49,741
But only one survived.

1268
01:54:56,372 --> 01:54:58,459
I am Ta'nok.

1269
01:54:59,678 --> 01:55:02,365
Look what they did to me!

1270
01:55:03,226 --> 01:55:04,583
They shot me!

1271
01:55:04,825 --> 01:55:06,526
They blinded me!

1272
01:55:07,787 --> 01:55:11,175
Look what the celestial beings have done to me!

1273
01:55:11,253 --> 01:55:13,365
Hakuna has arrived,

1274
01:55:14,088 --> 01:55:16,144
but the flood has not yet reached its peak.

1275
01:55:16,169 --> 01:55:19,198
until the solar eclipse the day after tomorrow.

1276
01:55:19,223 --> 01:55:20,630
Then we attack.

1277
01:55:21,171 --> 01:55:22,658
No, wait a minute.

1278
01:55:22,683 --> 01:55:24,864
Let's talk about a massacre.

1279
01:55:24,889 --> 01:55:25,477
Boe.

1280
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:28,251
Hundreds dead, an entire region wiped out.

1281
01:55:28,276 --> 01:55:29,724
That's the beauty of this plan.

1282
01:55:29,749 --> 01:55:31,710
We can reach the annual quota in a single day.

1283
01:55:31,735 --> 01:55:34,507
These beings are intelligent and possess a soul.

1284
01:55:34,532 --> 01:55:39,674
Who are you… Ian Garmin, marine biologist?

1285
01:55:40,505 --> 01:55:44,071
These beings possess culture and music.

1286
01:55:44,111 --> 01:55:46,340
They call each other by nicknames. This can be avoided.

1287
01:55:46,365 --> 01:55:50,140
This meeting is intentional. It is a spiritual meeting.

1288
01:55:50,164 --> 01:55:53,421
You're right, Garmin. We all made an agreement.

1289
01:55:53,446 --> 01:55:55,741
No, I did not agree.

1290
01:55:55,766 --> 01:55:57,899
Dr. Garmin, thank you very much.

1291
01:55:57,930 --> 01:55:59,391
Their protest was recorded.

1292
01:55:59,416 --> 01:56:01,416
Selected? Yes.

1293
01:56:01,812 --> 01:56:06,325
Small teams and fast boats form a series.

1294
01:56:06,664 --> 01:56:08,404
Direct family groups here.

1295
01:56:08,429 --> 01:56:12,210
Until a narrow passage forms between the others.

1296
01:56:13,243 --> 01:56:16,083
Jake Sully, Traitor to Humanity

1297
01:56:22,487 --> 01:56:24,270
I've already forgotten again.

1298
01:56:25,710 --> 01:56:27,280
Hey, make way!

1299
01:56:28,668 --> 01:56:30,667
Open up!

1300
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,280
Weapons, sir!

1301
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,819
This is the end of your journey, Jake.

1302
01:56:44,743 --> 01:56:46,759
Tomorrow at 6:00 PM.

1303
01:56:49,183 --> 01:56:51,260
You are mistaken about your heart.

1304
01:56:51,622 --> 01:56:54,704
But I will use the old method, the firing squad.

1305
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:59,103
Selfridge claims it's nicer.

1306
01:56:59,281 --> 01:57:02,390
So you're just a simple courier?

1307
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:06,553
It's not their fault.

1308
01:57:09,290 --> 01:57:11,473
This is for me and for you.

1309
01:57:12,156 --> 01:57:14,933
Because of the marine who abused my trust.

1310
01:57:15,722 --> 01:57:18,216
Because of the men and women I have lost.

1311
01:57:23,690 --> 01:57:25,556
Memories of a dead person.

1312
01:57:28,489 --> 01:57:31,414
Miles Quaritch is dead.

1313
01:57:32,708 --> 01:57:34,404
You are free.

1314
01:57:35,366 --> 01:57:37,861
There is a world out there.

1315
01:57:37,886 --> 01:57:41,607
There are things these masters will never understand.

1316
01:57:43,089 --> 01:57:46,039
The Na'vi call him a weapons carrier.

1317
01:57:46,064 --> 01:57:46,759
See?

1318
01:57:46,784 --> 01:57:48,256
You know what it's called.

1319
01:57:48,281 --> 01:57:50,442
So, learn to look!

1320
01:57:50,822 --> 01:57:53,377
Connect with something greater than yourself…

1321
01:57:53,409 --> 01:57:56,397
… bigger than you could ever imagine.

1322
01:57:58,280 --> 01:58:00,280
Let's explore this world.

1323
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:04,920
Look at yourself.

1324
01:58:08,948 --> 01:58:13,336
Meeting at 6 p.m.

1325
01:59:09,630 --> 01:59:12,280
Now they are powerless in the village.

1326
01:59:32,595 --> 01:59:33,685
Hands on the wall!

1327
01:59:34,184 --> 01:59:35,565
Hands on the wall!

1328
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:40,638
Okay, everything is fine.

1329
01:59:53,730 --> 01:59:56,280
Nothing serious, just gas.

1330
02:00:25,859 --> 02:00:27,383
Take care of me.

1331
02:00:48,816 --> 02:00:51,280
Okay, he has a doctorate.

1332
02:00:51,730 --> 02:00:53,280
What do you do now?

1333
02:01:12,817 --> 02:01:13,952
Look here!

1334
02:01:18,219 --> 02:01:19,624
How are you, my beauties?

1335
02:01:22,677 --> 02:01:23,876
Drink and dig!

1336
02:01:31,999 --> 02:01:33,999
Quaritch, Quaritch!

1337
02:01:37,302 --> 02:01:38,280
We are fire.

1338
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:39,280
Monk's fire!

1339
02:01:39,281 --> 02:01:41,280
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1340
02:01:52,718 --> 02:01:55,292
Don't fire me, Vještice!

1341
02:01:55,573 --> 02:01:56,973
What is Shexory?

1342
02:01:57,266 --> 02:02:00,180
A woman. Faithful to her husband.

1343
02:02:00,205 --> 02:02:01,794
Speak up, or I'll hang up.

1344
02:02:05,812 --> 02:02:09,568
Where? I'm not asking again.

1345
02:02:12,226 --> 02:02:14,222
No, okay.

1346
02:02:15,267 --> 02:02:16,280
It's a warehouse.

1347
02:02:17,630 --> 02:02:20,659
Okay, that's for the animals. Take me there.

1348
02:02:21,436 --> 02:02:24,280
Run. Which way? Hey, shoot him!

1349
02:02:28,281 --> 02:02:29,823
Let's go to the party!

1350
02:02:41,743 --> 02:02:44,280
Catch him! I want him!

1351
02:02:58,126 --> 02:02:59,413
Schnell, schnell!

1352
02:03:30,431 --> 02:03:31,431
Jake!

1353
02:03:33,718 --> 02:03:36,004
General, I have a problem.

1354
02:03:36,029 --> 02:03:37,879
No, I have a problem.

1355
02:03:38,101 --> 02:03:41,100
The child is on the run and I must find it alive.

1356
02:03:50,437 --> 02:03:51,859
Attack him!

1357
02:04:25,136 --> 02:04:28,076
MILES „SPIDER“ SOCORRO AWARD SEC-OPS CONTACT

1358
02:04:42,973 --> 02:04:45,691
Get out of here, quickly, quickly!

1359
02:04:50,554 --> 02:04:52,293
Get lost!

1360
02:04:59,335 --> 02:05:00,888
Break it now!

1361
02:05:07,544 --> 02:05:08,758
The! Jake!

1362
02:05:12,361 --> 02:05:13,361
Mist!

1363
02:05:16,893 --> 02:05:18,280
Naturally.

1364
02:05:21,510 --> 02:05:22,817
It's getting dark.

1365
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:30,473
Stay with me.

1366
02:05:38,987 --> 02:05:40,125
Stay with me.

1367
02:05:45,461 --> 02:05:47,873
What am I supposed to do? What am I even doing here?

1368
02:05:53,493 --> 02:05:55,493
Haha... Huuuh...

1369
02:06:10,030 --> 02:06:12,280
Is my protest being recorded, you asshole?

1370
02:06:20,692 --> 02:06:23,280
Jake, this way.

1371
02:06:23,508 --> 02:06:25,168
No, no, this way.

1372
02:06:25,281 --> 02:06:26,280
Okay.

1373
02:06:29,281 --> 02:06:31,701
Ian Garmin. Marine biologist. Oh.

1374
02:06:32,219 --> 02:06:36,109
Come on! Honestly, I love everything you do.

1375
02:06:36,134 --> 02:06:39,821
I am inspired. Her silence…

1376
02:06:40,975 --> 02:06:44,909
What is this? I can't take it anymore.

1377
02:06:45,503 --> 02:06:48,465
But there is no plan. Only Neytiri.

1378
02:06:48,555 --> 02:06:49,602
The.

1379
02:06:54,329 --> 02:06:55,465
Schnell, schnell!

1380
02:06:58,221 --> 02:06:59,681
Schnell! Schnell!

1381
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:10,079
Why are you doing that?

1382
02:07:10,527 --> 02:07:15,151
A large meeting is taking place this evening. But the day after tomorrow,

1383
02:07:15,512 --> 02:07:17,936
They will attack with all their ships.

1384
02:07:18,076 --> 02:07:20,157
Okay. I have a ceremony.

1385
02:07:21,703 --> 02:07:24,828
You must stop them. Only you can.

1386
02:07:26,043 --> 02:07:27,193
Go.

1387
02:07:36,881 --> 02:07:38,943
Stop it. Be quiet.

1388
02:07:41,794 --> 02:07:42,901
Let's go.

1389
02:07:51,281 --> 02:07:53,179
Go now. Go.

1390
02:08:00,603 --> 02:08:01,496
Damned.

1391
02:08:02,281 --> 02:08:03,466
Go on, get out of here.

1392
02:08:05,666 --> 02:08:07,220
Oh, Jake. Come on.

1393
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:14,373
Beyond 1-6, the target fell behind the vehicle.

1394
02:08:15,950 --> 02:08:17,233
Change missile, destroy.

1395
02:08:17,272 --> 02:08:18,385
We need to shoot them down, change missiles.

1396
02:08:18,410 --> 02:08:19,545
CHOOSE A WEAPON

1397
02:08:20,232 --> 02:08:21,445
Hey, what's wrong with me?

1398
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:27,061
Jake recognizes this item. Oh yes! I don't need this junk!

1399
02:08:28,239 --> 02:08:31,068
How did you read me?

1400
02:08:32,875 --> 02:08:36,323
Children wearing breathing apparatus are blocking my view.

1401
02:08:36,879 --> 02:08:39,230
Don't shoot! Tell him not to shoot!

1402
02:08:39,909 --> 02:08:41,280
Despite 1-6. Despite 1.

1403
02:08:41,281 --> 02:08:44,004
Don't shoot! Keep him in your sights!

1404
02:08:44,029 --> 02:08:46,443
1-6, cease fire! Secure the position of our resources!

1405
02:08:46,468 --> 02:08:49,913
Yes, you won't shoot me. Do you know why? Because you can't.

1406
02:08:50,388 --> 02:08:53,249
No, you can't. Get lost!

1407
02:08:53,281 --> 02:08:55,280
Yes! Come on, Jake, go!

1408
02:08:55,281 --> 02:08:57,466
What are you doing? Hurry up!

1409
02:08:57,491 --> 02:08:58,891
The, the!

1410
02:08:59,985 --> 02:09:01,718
He is moving west. The destination is determined.

1411
02:09:01,743 --> 02:09:03,631
The goal is unclear.

1412
02:09:04,501 --> 02:09:05,997
They have me in their sights.

1413
02:09:11,647 --> 02:09:13,280
Stay close to me.

1414
02:09:13,281 --> 02:09:16,195
I don't want to play. Pass 1-6, shoot!

1415
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:18,219
No, don't shoot.

1416
02:09:18,257 --> 02:09:20,256
Back! Cease fire!

1417
02:09:20,281 --> 02:09:21,280
Schnell, schnell!

1418
02:09:21,848 --> 02:09:23,280
Despite 1-6.

1419
02:09:23,305 --> 02:09:25,003
You have permission. Free fire.

1420
02:09:25,028 --> 02:09:26,983
Visual obstruction. I'm back.

1421
02:09:29,190 --> 02:09:30,996
He's back. This way.

1422
02:09:31,257 --> 02:09:33,256
Blue here. Fire at will!

1423
02:09:33,281 --> 02:09:35,280
Pass 1-6. Fire at will!

1424
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:37,170
1-6, shoot!

1425
02:09:53,735 --> 02:09:56,708
Mein Jake. Neytiri.

1426
02:09:57,661 --> 02:10:01,280
Honey, I don't know whether to kiss you or hit you.

1427
02:10:01,603 --> 02:10:02,997
You're wasting your time.

1428
02:10:03,450 --> 02:10:04,811
Come on, let's go.

1429
02:10:07,013 --> 02:10:08,612
Let's go! Yay!

1430
02:10:23,072 --> 02:10:24,712
Down. Anywhere.

1431
02:10:46,882 --> 02:10:48,960
I need to go.

1432
02:10:49,649 --> 02:10:51,416
You landed at exactly the right moment.

1433
02:10:52,514 --> 02:10:53,521
What is that?

1434
02:10:54,174 --> 02:10:56,053
Why did we stop?

1435
02:11:00,499 --> 02:11:02,769
They didn't even patent the lawsuit.

1436
02:11:02,794 --> 02:11:03,793
That's funny.

1437
02:11:05,017 --> 02:11:07,989
Good idea. Drink first, then go in the river.

1438
02:11:08,014 --> 02:11:11,283
What's wrong, Jake? I made a mistake.

1439
02:11:12,530 --> 02:11:14,155
We cannot protect it.

1440
02:11:15,601 --> 02:11:18,639
I have to remove it. For hygienic reasons.

1441
02:11:19,050 --> 02:11:22,665
She's incredible. There's a woman who always finds him.

1442
02:11:24,410 --> 02:11:27,289
They will catch him. They will study him.

1443
02:11:27,984 --> 02:11:30,286
And when people can breathe air again,

1444
02:11:31,914 --> 02:11:34,862
It will spread all over the world.

1445
02:11:35,251 --> 02:11:39,463
Then they will destroy the forest, the ocean, everything that exists on Earth.

1446
02:11:40,111 --> 02:11:42,964
Then the Na'vi will disappear.

1447
02:11:43,889 --> 02:11:45,889
The Tulkun will disappear.

1448
02:11:46,657 --> 02:11:50,163
And I cannot allow that.

1449
02:11:50,195 --> 02:11:52,195
Kiss him, then start.

1450
02:11:58,597 --> 02:12:00,252
You're right.

1451
02:12:05,145 --> 02:12:07,145
He/We must do it.

1452
02:12:08,562 --> 02:12:09,562
Jake.

1453
02:12:12,056 --> 02:12:13,556
He saved your life.

1454
02:12:25,530 --> 02:12:27,030
It is the only solution.

1455
02:12:39,987 --> 02:12:40,987
Spider!

1456
02:12:43,071 --> 02:12:44,071
You are.

1457
02:12:51,554 --> 02:12:52,554
What's up?

1458
02:12:55,879 --> 02:12:56,879
What's up?

1459
02:12:57,835 --> 02:12:58,835
Come with me.

1460
02:13:02,012 --> 02:13:03,012
Come on, hurry up.

1461
02:13:12,847 --> 02:13:14,560
Wait a minute, I need to go to the toilet.

1462
02:13:14,585 --> 02:13:16,585
Stay close to us.

1463
02:13:25,490 --> 02:13:28,130
Where are we going? Silence.

1464
02:13:44,200 --> 02:13:46,407
Is this some kind of meeting?

1465
02:13:59,482 --> 02:14:01,883
Come here. Let's go.

1466
02:14:05,665 --> 02:14:06,664
There are rocks here.

1467
02:14:08,409 --> 02:14:10,693
On your knees!

1468
02:14:11,394 --> 02:14:13,394
No! Get on your knees immediately!

1469
02:14:14,114 --> 02:14:17,498
Please. Jake, stop!

1470
02:14:18,233 --> 02:14:19,479
Look ahead!

1471
02:14:19,557 --> 02:14:21,932
Don't move! Please!

1472
02:14:22,252 --> 02:14:24,273
You don't have to do that.

1473
02:14:25,682 --> 02:14:27,175
Please.

1474
02:14:27,788 --> 02:14:30,196
Grandma, are you there?

1475
02:14:31,521 --> 02:14:33,430
You don't have to do that.

1476
02:14:33,860 --> 02:14:35,925
Take my hand. Please don't do that.

1477
02:14:35,969 --> 02:14:38,325
Give me strength. Stop.

1478
02:14:38,860 --> 02:14:40,948
Please stop. Please.

1479
02:14:41,428 --> 02:14:44,272
Don't look at me. Please don't look at me.

1480
02:14:47,046 --> 02:14:48,499
Forgive your child!

1481
02:14:48,888 --> 02:14:51,452
I will be wise. If you are strong, I will prove it to you.

1482
02:14:51,691 --> 02:14:54,284
I promise you. When your body returns to the forest,

1483
02:14:56,147 --> 02:14:58,709
I ask you, Father, to maintain balance.

1484
02:14:59,499 --> 02:15:01,613
May your ancestors welcome you.

1485
02:15:16,799 --> 02:15:17,799
Please.

1486
02:15:18,535 --> 02:15:21,050
May your ancestors welcome you.

1487
02:15:21,586 --> 02:15:24,057
Let her sing you a song.

1488
02:15:24,459 --> 02:15:26,868
I know I have to go.

1489
02:15:28,127 --> 02:15:29,892
It's nothing.

1490
02:15:32,397 --> 02:15:36,053
Do you still love me?

1491
02:15:37,814 --> 02:15:39,480
You are my heart.

1492
02:16:22,265 --> 02:16:23,265
Jake.

1493
02:16:23,336 --> 02:16:24,336
Mein Jake.

1494
02:16:35,056 --> 02:16:36,309
I see you.

1495
02:16:44,086 --> 02:16:46,788
Whatever happens, it won't be like that.

1496
02:16:48,746 --> 02:16:51,241
So we'll find another solution.

1497
02:17:06,495 --> 02:17:12,010
My father knew deep in his heart that there was only one way.

1498
02:17:18,544 --> 02:17:20,993
No matter how you introduce yourself

1499
02:17:21,248 --> 02:17:24,166
as a father, as a husband,

1500
02:17:24,914 --> 02:17:28,219
Sooner or later you will return to this path.

1501
02:17:47,034 --> 02:17:48,600
Hello, old friend.

1502
02:17:50,953 --> 02:17:53,075
Toruk loved my father.

1503
02:17:55,578 --> 02:17:57,805
He knew that together they were stronger.

1504
02:17:58,389 --> 02:18:01,673
If they stole, blood would be shed.

1505
02:18:04,893 --> 02:18:06,173
He is coming.

1506
02:18:30,103 --> 02:18:32,681
Toruk Makto.

1507
02:18:34,567 --> 02:18:39,678
No, no. Please. Wake up. Please.

1508
02:18:40,626 --> 02:18:42,546
Dear Jake.

1509
02:18:42,998 --> 02:18:45,716
Please. Everything's fine. Everything's fine.

1510
02:18:47,896 --> 02:18:52,689
Go to all the clans now, or in a few days. Talk to them.

1511
02:18:54,551 --> 02:18:57,294
Tell them to spread my message.

1512
02:18:59,053 --> 02:19:01,053
Please.

1513
02:19:01,982 --> 02:19:03,249
They will come.

1514
02:19:42,250 --> 02:19:46,064
And finally, Toruk Makto returned.

1515
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:49,895
My father reunited the clans.

1516
02:19:50,611 --> 02:19:52,200
He spoke emphatically.

1517
02:19:52,722 --> 02:19:56,398
He managed to bring everyone together. Without hesitation.

1518
02:19:58,216 --> 02:20:00,007
We were not deterred!

1519
02:20:07,616 --> 02:20:10,679
But he knew that wasn't enough.

1520
02:20:27,753 --> 02:20:28,963
Great Elder,

1521
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:30,889
Elderly wise men.

1522
02:20:32,634 --> 02:20:35,873
Today, people are coming down from the sky.

1523
02:20:36,277 --> 02:20:39,482
To kill our Tulkun family.

1524
02:20:40,495 --> 02:20:41,495
Please.

1525
02:20:42,612 --> 02:20:43,912
Fight with us.

1526
02:20:52,188 --> 02:20:55,087
Ka'e da po'tujemo Toruk Makta,

1527
02:20:55,653 --> 02:20:57,820
but our methods are outdated.

1528
02:21:01,656 --> 02:21:04,581
We believe that killing only has harmful consequences.

1529
02:21:04,606 --> 02:21:09,035
More and more murders, endlessly, the cycle widens.

1530
02:21:11,199 --> 02:21:12,716
Listen to my words.

1531
02:21:14,099 --> 02:21:16,499
The people of heaven will never cease.

1532
02:21:17,213 --> 02:21:19,637
Until the last Tulkun is captured.

1533
02:21:26,785 --> 02:21:27,785
Look!

1534
02:21:35,140 --> 02:21:37,450
My brother has to speak before the council.

1535
02:21:37,794 --> 02:21:39,402
Payakane, go away!

1536
02:21:39,541 --> 02:21:40,741
He shouldn't be here.

1537
02:21:40,772 --> 02:21:41,701
Look!

1538
02:21:42,301 --> 02:21:43,123
Halt!

1539
02:21:43,409 --> 02:21:44,349
He shouldn't be here.

1540
02:21:44,374 --> 02:21:45,361
Dad, come on!

1541
02:21:46,541 --> 02:21:49,556
I am Tulkun's brother. I have the right to speak.

1542
02:21:49,687 --> 02:21:52,787
Lo'ak speaks the truth. You must listen to him.

1543
02:21:52,813 --> 02:21:53,733
Tsireya!

1544
02:21:58,619 --> 02:22:01,199
He says his brother is an outcast.

1545
02:22:02,073 --> 02:22:04,513
There are no rights here.

1546
02:22:06,566 --> 02:22:10,666
If he's an outcast, then so am I.

1547
02:22:11,628 --> 02:22:15,296
I too am an outcast. My daughter, be quiet!

1548
02:22:15,433 --> 02:22:16,290
No!

1549
02:22:17,313 --> 02:22:19,189
You will never see me again.

1550
02:22:20,908 --> 02:22:24,619
My brother and I are outcasts. Oh no!

1551
02:22:25,466 --> 02:22:28,631
We too are outcasts.

1552
02:22:40,902 --> 02:22:44,460
He says you can speak.

1553
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:49,821
Listen to my words.

1554
02:22:50,091 --> 02:22:53,785
My brother returned to his clan to defend it.

1555
02:22:54,097 --> 02:22:57,736
But his clan was wiped out by demonic ships.

1556
02:22:58,195 --> 02:23:00,098
I thought no one had survived.

1557
02:23:00,393 --> 02:23:02,166
Because he fought.

1558
02:23:03,399 --> 02:23:04,904
Previously.

1559
02:23:32,765 --> 02:23:40,321
I'm not just talking about fallen mothers and dead tulkuns.

1560
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:49,284
I speak in the name of my people and all our songs.

1561
02:23:51,287 --> 02:23:52,287
Lost.

1562
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:54,820
Forever.

1563
02:24:00,467 --> 02:24:02,173
He says I'm the last one.

1564
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:05,314
A blind witness to our end.

1565
02:24:10,984 --> 02:24:14,256
He explains that the path of the Tulkun must change.

1566
02:24:14,776 --> 02:24:16,849
Payakan shows us how.

1567
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:26,415
We must fight!

1568
02:24:26,953 --> 02:24:28,876
We must fight!

1569
02:24:46,626 --> 02:24:47,746
What's up?

1570
02:24:48,660 --> 02:24:50,211
You will decide.

1571
02:24:51,715 --> 02:24:53,268
Look at all of this.

1572
02:24:54,181 --> 02:24:56,349
There are hundreds.

1573
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:00,017
And look at these old objects. And old objects have value.

1574
02:25:00,868 --> 02:25:02,865
They are growing continuously.

1575
02:25:03,335 --> 02:25:05,334
This means they are more visible on radar.

1576
02:25:06,099 --> 02:25:07,721
And look at this magnificent piece.

1577
02:25:08,155 --> 02:25:10,241
It must be about one hundred meters.

1578
02:25:10,915 --> 02:25:12,315
Meet without me.

1579
02:25:13,548 --> 02:25:15,128
An oversight, I assume?

1580
02:25:15,696 --> 02:25:17,230
No, it wasn't a mistake.

1581
02:25:17,421 --> 02:25:20,560
After your mishap with Sully, it's all over for you, Colonel.

1582
02:25:20,850 --> 02:25:23,472
They will be detained on the premises until the investigation is concluded.

1583
02:25:23,926 --> 02:25:25,894
I can't. I have to move.

1584
02:25:25,965 --> 02:25:29,018
Sully will be there, so Spider will be there too.

1585
02:25:29,050 --> 02:25:31,675
Don't look at him. He almost ended up in prison too.

1586
02:25:31,700 --> 02:25:33,871
Don't tell him not to look at me. What do you want to do?

1587
02:25:33,896 --> 02:25:35,203
Call the boss?

1588
02:25:35,228 --> 02:25:36,884
You mean the mayor? That's enough.

1589
02:25:38,617 --> 02:25:40,876
I can still complete this mission.

1590
02:25:41,331 --> 02:25:42,451
Look at you.

1591
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:44,646
You are dishonoring the uniform.

1592
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:47,160
If you still remember uniforms.

1593
02:25:48,152 --> 02:25:51,143
You are under arrest, Colonel. Permanently.

1594
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:08,820
Why are you here, child?

1595
02:26:10,653 --> 02:26:12,479
Fill it, Tsahik.

1596
02:26:16,686 --> 02:26:17,958
No, my child.

1597
02:26:21,547 --> 02:26:23,639
Why did you come to visit us? For this moment.

1598
02:26:26,663 --> 02:26:29,700
Perhaps only

1599
02:26:31,781 --> 02:26:34,168
Only the chosen ones will survive.

1600
02:26:34,679 --> 02:26:36,432
To the warrior, Mother.

1601
02:26:40,402 --> 02:26:41,406
Tsahik.

1602
02:26:42,495 --> 02:26:44,214
She gives birth.

1603
02:26:44,412 --> 02:26:47,898
I'm afraid you won't survive.

1604
02:26:51,766 --> 02:26:53,732
Oh, to the left.

1605
02:26:56,632 --> 02:26:58,159
Listen to me.

1606
02:26:59,313 --> 02:27:06,019
You can do something, so you must do it.

1607
02:27:08,503 --> 02:27:11,601
You have a strong heart.

1608
02:27:12,195 --> 02:27:13,195
Here.

1609
02:27:14,359 --> 02:27:17,483
I'll come with you. No, I need you here.

1610
02:27:19,391 --> 02:27:22,258
I can't do that if I don't know my children are safe.

1611
02:27:22,323 --> 02:27:24,307
Stay where you are, no matter what happens.

1612
02:27:24,602 --> 02:27:25,721
...

1613
02:27:25,913 --> 02:27:27,375
Then let's give it a try.

1614
02:27:33,822 --> 02:27:35,832
If your father and I do not return,

1615
02:27:36,007 --> 02:27:38,138
Take Spider and the girls,

1616
02:27:38,162 --> 02:27:41,661
and run as far and as fast as you can.

1617
02:28:26,765 --> 02:28:28,445
Boe.

1618
02:28:32,697 --> 02:28:35,110
Generally speaking, the river is outside the borders.

1619
02:28:35,609 --> 02:28:39,715
The range is enormous; this energy could destroy you.

1620
02:28:39,893 --> 02:28:42,275
Done. GunRunner moves to the right.

1621
02:28:58,226 --> 02:29:01,447
Come on, kids, have fun!

1622
02:29:02,235 --> 02:29:04,643
Let's go!

1623
02:29:15,279 --> 02:29:18,027
The team is ready to swim!

1624
02:29:40,200 --> 02:29:41,523
Is an enemy in sight?

1625
02:29:42,022 --> 02:29:43,653
No, no movement.

1626
02:29:43,889 --> 02:29:46,005
And the biggest one simply does his part.

1627
02:29:48,922 --> 02:29:50,701
Prelako, Scorzy.

1628
02:29:51,434 --> 02:29:52,434
Understood!

1629
02:29:56,294 --> 02:29:57,294
Come on.

1630
02:29:58,380 --> 02:29:59,380
Come on.

1631
02:30:00,813 --> 02:30:02,336
�ekaj!

1632
02:30:12,322 --> 02:30:13,322
Just a moment!

1633
02:30:14,577 --> 02:30:18,436
No boats. No large V-MUTs.

1634
02:30:19,395 --> 02:30:20,771
There are no elders present.

1635
02:30:23,234 --> 02:30:24,854
Prepare everything.

1636
02:30:25,708 --> 02:30:27,567
Lord, I have an excellent signal.

1637
02:30:28,087 --> 02:30:30,208
Tulkun the Great.

1638
02:30:30,874 --> 02:30:31,972
Many large ones.

1639
02:30:32,027 --> 02:30:33,607
Many Tulkuns are approaching.

1640
02:30:47,058 --> 02:30:49,229
You said they weren't aggressive.

1641
02:30:50,143 --> 02:30:51,943
Yes, well, no.

1642
02:30:52,552 --> 02:30:53,583
Open.

1643
02:30:54,132 --> 02:30:57,140
Payakane, I am taking orders.

1644
02:30:57,307 --> 02:30:59,381
Yes, the Matriarch.

1645
02:31:04,296 --> 02:31:05,821
I have a picture in my mind.

1646
02:31:36,781 --> 02:31:38,779
Boring!

1647
02:32:04,961 --> 02:32:06,196
Sad!

1648
02:32:08,702 --> 02:32:10,781
The time for execution has come.

1649
02:32:36,808 --> 02:32:37,945
Danger!

1650
02:33:01,045 --> 02:33:04,208
Weapon! Fire!

1651
02:33:36,602 --> 02:33:39,362
Loading! Caution!

1652
02:34:12,876 --> 02:34:15,956
Yes, Jake! Man... Look!

1653
02:34:28,610 --> 02:34:29,610
And!

1654
02:34:43,698 --> 02:34:44,738
The!

1655
02:34:48,671 --> 02:34:49,969
Is that ASH?

1656
02:34:50,562 --> 02:34:53,812
What do you think of our fish, rider? Over a hundred.

1657
02:34:54,093 --> 02:34:56,330
They are friendly. You might get a sign.

1658
02:34:56,433 --> 02:34:57,245
That's it.

1659
02:34:57,285 --> 02:35:01,358
Jake Sully, English, General. I'll take over.

1660
02:35:08,756 --> 02:35:09,824
Wow!

1661
02:35:37,053 --> 02:35:38,487
I cannot win.

1662
02:35:39,888 --> 02:35:41,516
They are dying!

1663
02:35:42,832 --> 02:35:44,832
Jake! Up!

1664
02:35:45,370 --> 02:35:47,950
Stop her! Kiri! Stop!

1665
02:35:48,418 --> 02:35:51,931
Kiri, stop! Go back immediately and take cover, it's not safe out there.

1666
02:35:51,963 --> 02:35:53,638
I must go to the Great Mother.

1667
02:35:53,663 --> 02:35:56,578
He can't do it, he'll die. He can't......

1668
02:35:56,603 --> 02:35:58,603
That's not possible now. Get out!

1669
02:35:58,944 --> 02:35:59,944
Back!

1670
02:35:59,969 --> 02:36:00,969
Links! 👍!

1671
02:36:02,881 --> 02:36:04,881
Letter, stop! Letter!

1672
02:36:05,130 --> 02:36:07,130
Links! Links!

1673
02:36:07,890 --> 02:36:09,483
Come on! No, wait!

1674
02:36:12,238 --> 02:36:13,612
Back! I mean it.

1675
02:36:14,179 --> 02:36:15,484
The, the!

1676
02:36:16,204 --> 02:36:18,428
Don't follow me! Come on!

1677
02:36:47,297 --> 02:36:49,906
Look! They're coming. Fight us!

1678
02:36:50,332 --> 02:36:52,525
We must protect the mothers.

1679
02:36:52,736 --> 02:36:54,617
Come on, I'll stay with her.

1680
02:36:55,061 --> 02:36:56,061
Goes!

1681
02:37:09,327 --> 02:37:12,294
Our Mother, hear my words.

1682
02:37:13,370 --> 02:37:15,393
Please help us.

1683
02:37:16,109 --> 02:37:17,668
Please,

1684
02:37:18,039 --> 02:37:20,039
You are our only hope.

1685
02:37:33,179 --> 02:37:36,084
Please! We need you.

1686
02:37:37,392 --> 02:37:39,411
Don't defend me!

1687
02:37:44,061 --> 02:37:48,369
Please don't! No, I beg you! I beg you!

1688
02:37:55,235 --> 02:37:57,695
No no no...

1689
02:37:59,524 --> 02:38:01,524
Monkeys, let's go!

1690
02:38:02,456 --> 02:38:03,416
The!

1691
02:38:05,924 --> 02:38:06,924
The!

1692
02:38:08,115 --> 02:38:08,980
Shoot!

1693
02:38:24,677 --> 02:38:27,171
Please!

1694
02:38:30,708 --> 02:38:32,067
No, please!

1695
02:38:32,306 --> 02:38:34,233
People are dying!

1696
02:38:42,002 --> 02:38:44,167
Please don't!

1697
02:38:46,194 --> 02:38:47,640
Knock! Come on!

1698
02:38:48,387 --> 02:38:51,094
Come on! We can do it!

1699
02:38:54,120 --> 02:38:55,771
Mom, you said it's true!

1700
02:39:12,594 --> 02:39:14,294
Come on, quickly!

1701
02:39:14,319 --> 02:39:16,608
Knock, knock! Come in!

1702
02:39:34,691 --> 02:39:37,910
Grandma, please help us!

1703
02:39:38,768 --> 02:39:40,889
People are dying!

1704
02:39:42,750 --> 02:39:44,948
I must warn you, Mother!

1705
02:39:45,074 --> 02:39:47,395
You are our only hope!

1706
02:40:45,490 --> 02:40:46,490
Fire!

1707
02:40:56,478 --> 02:40:58,478
No!

1708
02:41:01,299 --> 02:41:02,720
Here they come!

1709
02:41:08,551 --> 02:41:10,300
Blackout, surround him!

1710
02:41:40,978 --> 02:41:42,168
Brave Kinder!

1711
02:41:58,875 --> 02:42:00,610
Is everything alright? Yes.

1712
02:42:01,880 --> 02:42:03,050
Where is Kiri?

1713
02:42:08,227 --> 02:42:10,175
She is disabled.

1714
02:42:11,065 --> 02:42:14,341
Get to safety. Don't come back!

1715
02:42:16,381 --> 02:42:18,015
It's over.

1716
02:42:36,157 --> 02:42:36,817
Papa!

1717
02:42:38,210 --> 02:42:39,465
Look, Father.

1718
02:42:40,376 --> 02:42:42,097
Everything's fine, I'm with you.

1719
02:42:49,665 --> 02:42:50,660
Tsahik!

1720
02:43:03,374 --> 02:43:05,054
Stay here, I'll get them later.

1721
02:43:05,079 --> 02:43:07,347
You can't leave me alone.

1722
02:43:16,592 --> 02:43:17,852
Damza, okay!

1723
02:43:22,499 --> 02:43:25,119
I'm dying. No, I'm not dying.

1724
02:43:26,274 --> 02:43:28,885
Why do you always argue?

1725
02:43:28,910 --> 02:43:31,370
I am dying.

1726
02:43:31,408 --> 02:43:34,212
But first, I'll give birth to this child!

1727
02:43:42,621 --> 02:43:44,237
Do not print!

1728
02:43:46,486 --> 02:43:47,885
I love you!

1729
02:43:53,441 --> 02:43:54,368
Out of three.

1730
02:43:54,393 --> 02:43:55,381
No, don't do it.

1731
02:43:56,111 --> 02:43:56,893
Don't do that!

1732
02:43:56,918 --> 02:43:59,157
I will heal this wound!

1733
02:44:11,637 --> 02:44:14,780
Links!

1734
02:44:23,380 --> 02:44:24,930
Agreed?

1735
02:44:26,284 --> 02:44:28,284
I'm doing well. Very well!

1736
02:44:29,595 --> 02:44:31,155
Print, Tsahik!

1737
02:44:35,374 --> 02:44:37,707
One more try.

1738
02:44:39,020 --> 02:44:40,776
It's outside.

1739
02:44:41,068 --> 02:44:42,168
It's outside.

1740
02:44:45,825 --> 02:44:47,413
Thank you, my child.

1741
02:44:53,461 --> 02:44:54,736
Thanks.

1742
02:44:56,303 --> 02:44:57,583
Neytiri!

1743
02:44:58,102 --> 02:44:59,516
Thank you.

1744
02:45:03,361 --> 02:45:05,121
What is her name?

1745
02:45:06,693 --> 02:45:09,248
She is beautiful.

1746
02:45:12,307 --> 02:45:14,604
Ro'a.

1747
02:45:18,522 --> 02:45:20,721
A beautiful name.

1748
02:45:21,815 --> 02:45:23,758
You will protect her.

1749
02:45:25,381 --> 02:45:26,381
And.

1750
02:45:50,143 --> 02:45:52,163
Dad, I'm sorry I left my post.

1751
02:45:52,852 --> 02:45:54,712
Okay, my son. No.

1752
02:45:54,972 --> 02:45:57,072
You have proven yourself in my eyes.

1753
02:45:58,216 --> 02:46:01,489
I mean, you're always better prepared for the fight.

1754
02:46:02,413 --> 02:46:04,413
May my words not be in vain…

1755
02:46:04,986 --> 02:46:06,986
And you did it.

1756
02:46:07,460 --> 02:46:08,669
I'm proud of you.

1757
02:46:37,326 --> 02:46:40,386
22. What is the current situation? Are there any victims?

1758
02:46:40,893 --> 02:46:42,073
Okay, guys.

1759
02:46:43,334 --> 02:46:46,819
Get a grip. We still have work to do.

1760
02:46:47,469 --> 02:46:48,731
Seriously?

1761
02:46:50,601 --> 02:46:53,368
One hundred billion dollars await us in the Gulf. 1764 02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:55.202 But our lives are never normal. 1765 02:46:57.250 --> 02:46:58.843 I'll pay for the beer. 1766 02:47:00.959 --> 02:47:02.958 Zoves Brielle. 1767 02:47:04.545 --> 02:47:07.449 Your mother is strong. You will be strong too.

1762
02:47:28,311 --> 02:47:29,831
War booty.

1763
02:47:30,723 --> 02:47:33,369
Dad, Dad! Look!

1764
02:47:44,821 --> 02:47:46,483
I need you now.

1765
02:47:47,656 --> 02:47:49,243
With you.

1766
02:47:49,414 --> 02:47:51,460
I need my partner.

1767
02:47:52,007 --> 02:47:54,318
Okay, let's get started.

1768
02:48:06,747 --> 02:48:09,672
Jake, I know you're there.

1769
02:48:09,696 --> 02:48:11,056
I know you can hear me.

1770
02:48:12,072 --> 02:48:14,979
We are here. Your wife has suffered enough.

1771
02:48:20,601 --> 02:48:22,255
No!

1772
02:48:23,780 --> 02:48:27,719
Now you'll learn and take Spider with you.

1773
02:48:27,744 --> 02:48:30,479
And I know he can hear it.

1774
02:48:31,237 --> 02:48:32,720
Thank you, darling.

1775
02:48:37,957 --> 02:48:40,857
Okay. Come in. Quickly!

1776
02:48:55,862 --> 02:48:57,133
You brought her down.

1777
02:48:57,157 --> 02:48:59,357
Collect the biggest ones.

1778
02:49:15,820 --> 02:49:19,500
A few meters further on. Give me some space.

1779
02:49:21,598 --> 02:49:22,598
Damned!

1780
02:49:25,570 --> 02:49:27,278
Keep it up, smart aleck.

1781
02:49:27,303 --> 02:49:28,545
We scattered.

1782
02:49:30,418 --> 02:49:33,139
Multiple teams, torpedoes ready.

1783
02:49:33,190 --> 02:49:34,263
Which torpedoes?

1784
02:49:34,288 --> 02:49:37,538
Hermit in front of the torpedo, 60 meters.

1785
02:49:38,139 --> 02:49:39,325
Torpedoes ready.

1786
02:49:46,214 --> 02:49:48,128
The target is locked.

1787
02:49:51,280 --> 02:49:53,135
Ready to fire.

1788
02:50:03,723 --> 02:50:05,293
Look here!

1789
02:50:20,391 --> 02:50:21,414
Stop firing.

1790
02:50:21,761 --> 02:50:23,241
Why stop the fire?

1791
02:50:23,266 --> 02:50:24,905
There's a problem over there.

1792
02:50:25,550 --> 02:50:27,470
It's Eywa, it worked!

1793
02:50:27,963 --> 02:50:29,160
It worked!

1794
02:50:39,577 --> 02:50:41,577
Choose the celestial beings...

1795
02:50:42,617 --> 02:50:43,991
Kill them!

1796
02:50:44,016 --> 02:50:45,371
Kill them all!

1797
02:50:50,903 --> 02:50:51,903
Caution!

1798
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:07,360
Caution!

1799
02:51:15,739 --> 02:51:17,432
Hurry, hurry, strike!

1800
02:51:18,020 --> 02:51:20,804
All boats return to the ship!

1801
02:51:23,218 --> 02:51:24,269
And!

1802
02:51:24,684 --> 02:51:25,864
Exactly, Bellows!

1803
02:52:25,452 --> 02:52:28,765
Get us out of here! The locomotives have broken down.

1804
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:30,447
Howard, help me!

1805
02:53:32,273 --> 02:53:35,966
General, what is our next step?

1806
02:53:38,043 --> 02:53:39,773
Leave the ship!

1807
02:53:40,353 --> 02:53:42,292
Leave the ship!

1808
02:53:47,821 --> 02:53:49,261
Stay close to us!

1809
02:54:00,231 --> 02:54:01,311
Stay close to us!

1810
02:54:03,798 --> 02:54:04,518
Here!

1811
02:54:06,010 --> 02:54:06,730
Here.

1812
02:54:12,659 --> 02:54:13,266
Hide!

1813
02:54:23,111 --> 02:54:24,590
I need fire support.

1814
02:54:25,156 --> 02:54:25,979
...

1815
02:54:26,190 --> 02:54:28,394
Moved to the left, left flank.

1816
02:54:28,670 --> 02:54:30,448
They're coming from behind. Watch out!

1817
02:54:30,480 --> 02:54:32,435
Look at me. On command, sir.

1818
02:54:32,460 --> 02:54:34,294
Don't shoot your loved ones.

1819
02:54:35,074 --> 02:54:36,247
Fast!

1820
02:54:49,273 --> 02:54:51,373
Colonel, this is Spider speaking.

1821
02:54:51,398 --> 02:54:53,939
I'm here. Don't kill them.

1822
02:54:56,969 --> 02:54:59,864
Where are you, my son? Come out.

1823
02:55:01,703 --> 02:55:03,716
Okay. I'm leaving.

1824
02:55:16,763 --> 02:55:21,431
Spider, can you hear me? Time is running out.

1825
02:55:29,582 --> 02:55:30,901
The! The!

1826
02:55:46,525 --> 02:55:48,452
I am here to close a deal.

1827
02:55:48,902 --> 02:55:52,505
I'll do it in exchange for her. It's possible.

1828
02:55:53,216 --> 02:55:56,714
Come with me, my son. I am a man of his word.

1829
02:55:56,929 --> 02:56:00,315
We can end this now. Everyone can go home.

1830
02:56:10,636 --> 02:56:13,369
Let's gather. Let's get out of here.

1831
02:56:36,587 --> 02:56:37,587
Tuk

1832
02:56:43,783 --> 02:56:44,783
Hurry up, fatso!

1833
02:57:00,223 --> 02:57:03,036
Don't touch my mother!

1834
02:57:09,492 --> 02:57:10,612
Look!

1835
02:57:38,954 --> 02:57:41,446
Find your mother! Get her off the ship! 1843 02:58:19.047 --> 02:58:21.085 Is Dad there, Jake?

1836
02:58:33,371 --> 02:58:35,373
Jake! Spider!

1837
02:58:47,599 --> 02:58:50,347
Schnell! Schnell!

1838
02:59:14,923 --> 02:59:15,923
Damned!

1839
02:59:24,381 --> 02:59:26,381
Jake! Jake!

1840
02:59:44,847 --> 02:59:47,033
I'll kill you! I swear!

1841
02:59:48,117 --> 02:59:49,981
Would you be capable of killing your own father?

1842
02:59:51,105 --> 02:59:53,309
Don't tempt me!

1843
02:59:56,007 --> 02:59:57,709
You don't have to.

1844
03:00:00,055 --> 03:00:02,099
Watch out!

1845
03:00:04,733 --> 03:00:06,674
The! Jake, the!

1846
03:00:07,537 --> 03:00:09,045
Get out of here! Quickly!

1847
03:01:22,405 --> 03:01:23,513
Boo!

1848
03:01:43,162 --> 03:01:45,575
Jake... Jake...

1849
03:01:51,607 --> 03:01:52,644
Ton!

1850
03:01:54,866 --> 03:01:56,368
Spider, no!

1851
03:01:59,140 --> 03:02:01,140
Throw it! Go!

1852
03:02:05,576 --> 03:02:09,082
Pick it up! Go!

1853
03:02:10,639 --> 03:02:12,858
I wish you hadn't shot me in the arm!

1854
03:02:15,892 --> 03:02:17,902
I won't let you die.

1855
03:02:18,090 --> 03:02:20,234
Dann, you are! Dad?

1856
03:02:21,433 --> 03:02:23,499
You are a difficult child.

1857
03:02:24,246 --> 03:02:25,660
Hold me tight!

1858
03:02:48,958 --> 03:02:50,503
Take my hand.

1859
03:02:57,278 --> 03:02:58,278
Jake!

1860
03:02:58,997 --> 03:02:59,997
Come on!

1861
03:03:01,476 --> 03:03:02,476
Please.

1862
03:03:03,121 --> 03:03:04,121
Please.

1863
03:03:20,632 --> 03:03:22,479
It's... embarrassing.

1864
03:03:29,538 --> 03:03:30,740
Too sad?

1865
03:03:31,651 --> 03:03:35,207
What if we all held hands and sang?

1866
03:03:36,093 --> 03:03:38,101
I am learning to observe.

1867
03:03:40,348 --> 03:03:41,883
There is a choice.

1868
03:03:53,464 --> 03:03:54,617
�ekaj!

1869
03:03:55,371 --> 03:03:57,004
Come on! Come on!

1870
03:03:57,559 --> 03:03:58,745
Come on! Come on!

1871
03:04:05,265 --> 03:04:07,351
Damn, that really hurts.

1872
03:04:33,672 --> 03:04:35,682
Dad? Hi Jake?

1873
03:04:36,416 --> 03:04:38,280
Sit down! Come here!

1874
03:04:55,055 --> 03:04:56,999
The light always returns.

1875
03:05:09,429 --> 03:05:12,073
We are all connected to the Great Mother.

1876
03:05:14,779 --> 03:05:17,730
She carries all her children in her heart.

1877
03:05:21,923 --> 03:05:25,336
New life maintains the energy flow.

1878
03:05:27,146 --> 03:05:28,769
Like the breath of the world.

1879
03:05:32,179 --> 03:05:34,643
We hear my brother's voice.

1880
03:05:36,180 --> 03:05:38,369
The clan took him in.

1881
03:05:52,758 --> 03:05:57,671
In the spirit world, we invoke the power of our ancestors.

1882
03:06:00,022 --> 03:06:03,267
All those who have walked this path before us.

1883
03:06:15,214 --> 03:06:17,812
Come on, monkey, come on!

1884
03:06:26,631 --> 03:06:27,631
You are.

1885
03:06:28,315 --> 03:06:29,315
You are.

1886
03:06:38,415 --> 03:06:39,415
Sir,

1887
03:06:41,383 --> 03:06:43,663
I see you!

1888
03:06:44,149 --> 03:06:45,149
Fire!

1889
03:06:47,073 --> 03:06:48,067
Crazy!

1890
03:06:49,511 --> 03:06:51,394
Nice to see you, brother.

1891
03:06:52,795 --> 03:06:56,628
Mom, this is Spider.

1892
03:06:57,261 --> 03:06:59,102
I've heard a lot about you.

1893
03:07:00,192 --> 03:07:01,817
It rises.

1894
03:07:04,962 --> 03:07:08,128
Live for the first time.

1895
03:07:08,455 --> 03:07:11,821
And your spirit will live on in Eywa.

1896
03:07:12,843 --> 03:07:13,945
Forever.

1897
03:07:15,277 --> 03:07:18,538
You now belong to us.

1898
03:07:18,761 --> 03:07:21,784
You are one of us.

1899
03:07:22,407 --> 03:07:24,085
Boé.

1900
03:07:28,407 --> 03:07:33,085
...

1901
03:08:08,968 --> 03:08:12,484
Our love will never die.

1902
03:08:12,509 --> 03:08:16,028
# We are diamonds in the darkness. #

1903
03:08:16,330 --> 03:08:19,546
I place my hand on your chest.

1904
03:08:20,077 --> 03:08:22,641
# And I listen to your heart. #

1905
03:08:22,735 --> 03:08:25,556
Because you are my hope.

1906
03:08:26,298 --> 03:08:29,644
No matter where I go.

1907
03:08:29,889 --> 03:08:32,495
Never alone.

1908
03:08:33,469 --> 03:08:37,353
Because somehow I'm always away.

1909
03:08:38,791 --> 03:08:41,577
Even through the flames.

1910
03:08:42,399 --> 03:08:45,665
Even through the ash in the sky.

1911
03:08:45,924 --> 03:08:52,012
# Darling, when we dream, we all dream together. #

1912
03:08:52,984 --> 03:08:56,393
# With every breath. #

1913
03:08:56,532 --> 03:09:00,120
This is a song to keep this love alive.

1914
03:09:00,145 --> 03:09:06,333
I know that when we dream, we all dream together.
