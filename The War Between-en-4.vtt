WEBVTT

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.600
{\an8}In the words of a great man,
"We can be heroes."

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.800
Let's save the world.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.040
Bloody hell,
this place is incredible.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.280
I feel like I know you,
or I'm going to know you.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.400
Or I've known you forever.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.880
The tides have drawn us together.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.200
If Homo Aqua want
a war between the land and the sea,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.160
- we'll take the sea.
- Sir, this kind
of rhetoric is irresponsible.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.200
If you're trying to keep the peace,
you've already failed.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.360
Welcome...

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.760
..to our domain.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.640
Does the word "Severance" mean
anything to you?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.520
Coded messages going back and forth.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.720
Your war...

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.240
..is lost.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.000
WHALE SINGS

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.960
SCREAMING

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.520
Shots fired! Shots fired!

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.240
Man down! Code Red!

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.680
Urgent assistance required!

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.000
Code Red. All ground teams,
Sandown Building!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.560
- Code Red!
- Go! Come on!

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.320
Target building opposite.
India House.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.400
Estimate floor 35.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.520
Estimate floor 35.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.640
{\an8}Squad Three, Sandown Building.
Squad Four, India House.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.040
{\an8}Emergency comms from the Diplomatic
Zone, we have an event.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.000
{\an8}- What does that mean?
- A sonic pulse.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
{\an8}- What does that mean?
- Integrity lost.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.840
{\an8}Jane, please, what does that mean?

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.280
They're dead.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.440
All comms through me, register
Shirley Anne Bingham now in command.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.680
Options one to five schematics
installed,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.280
all stations on Red Alert.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.560
Tell me, what do we know?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.120
Gunman sighted!

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.560
Ma'am, we're under fire!

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.280
SIREN WAILS

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.360
Shots fired! Suspect down.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.560
No signs of life.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.080
Suspect terminated.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.800
Who is he?

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.920
Shirley, do we know who he is?

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.200
Apologies, ma'am, we don't know.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.840
And I'm sorry, but we have a major
incident in progress.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.600
And we're getting news
from military sources.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.960
Er, I'm sorry, this just coming
into us at 5am GMT.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.800
But it's just been confirmed
that there has been

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.600
an underwater explosion at the site
of the diplomatic meeting.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.960
It's assumed that all human
diplomats have perished

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.560
and their diplomacy efforts
have failed.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.360
This represents a major escalation
in the war

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.880
between Homo Aqua and mankind.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.880
And the Homo Aqua ambassador has
issued a statement

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.960
claiming responsibility for
the deaths of the H2O diplomats.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.040
What?!

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.960
{\an8}This is a warning

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.280
{\an8}to the human race.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.240
{\an8}Your diplomats are dead.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.960
{\an8}Their blood and marrow now feed
our children.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.960
The same fate will befall anyone who
dares to enter our waters.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.960
The time for diplomacy is over.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.840
Our borders are defended
and forbidden.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.840
{\an8}The water of the world will
never be yours again.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.800
Where is this from?
Steve, is that real?

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.120
- Could be a deepfake.
- Then find out!

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.480
We have a visual on the target.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.560
It wasn't Salt.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.280
I swear to you, I'm a witness.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.760
The device was exploded by
Ted Campbell.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.720
Theodore Campbell, OK?

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.760
He was the one...

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.720
They all died.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.400
They were crushed...

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.760
..right in front of me.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.840
In one second flat,
they were gone.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.000
Can I ask...

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.960
- ..how old was Min?
- 28.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.440
If it's any consolation, it must
have been instantaneous.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.640
No, no, they knew.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.360
In that second...

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.760
..I'm sorry, they knew.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.040
OK.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.640
We've told your family you're safe.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.240
And the most important thing now
is for you to get back here.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.680
Thank you, Mrs Bingham,
transfer to my desk.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.800
You shouldn't be here.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.920
Mr Pierre-Dupont, there is
one fundamental question.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.000
How the hell did you survive?

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.160
I'm not sure I did.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.120
You were lucky.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.920
That was a very long night.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.320
Yeah.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.200
We lost, erm...
We lost many good people.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.600
Did you survive because of her?

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.040
Yeah. She...

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.600
Yeah, she held me.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.040
And I don't know how or why.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.320
You do know that broadcast is
a fake, right?

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.040
I mean, for God's sake,
she's here with us.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.600
You took her on board,
she could've escaped,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.440
she had the whole ocean,
but she didn't!

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.480
She stayed...

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.720
..with me.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.080
And now you've got her under lock
and key.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.880
- Why don't you just talk to her?
- We'll do that, on dry land.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.240
All right, well, let me -
LET ME talk to her!

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.200
I'm afraid that's not possible.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.000
You have to remember,
five people are dead,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.440
and that happened on Aquakind
territory.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.520
In the eyes of the world,
she's taken responsibility.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.840
I can offer you no compromise.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.880
Salt is a prisoner of war.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.040
SCREAMING

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.760
And the names of the diplomats
killed in the undersea explosion

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.680
have now been confirmed.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.040
These include Unit Staff Captain
Louise Mackie,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.160
General Austin Pierce,
and Chief Technician Min Tso...

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.520
I don't suppose there's ever
going to be a body?

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.360
Don't think so.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.080
That sketch pad.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.840
She was always drawing.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.800
- CLEARS THROAT
- Erm, where shall I take this?

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.040
Sergeant Lake, he can pass it on.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.800
Louise's mother lives in Kirkcaldy.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.520
I'll take them.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.320
I'll visit her mother in person.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.480
In Kirkcaldy? When are you going to
find time for that?

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.160
She died under my instructions.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.080
I will find the time.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.520
Give us ten minutes.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.280
Any word from undersea?

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.640
It's gone quiet.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.080
And you're going to need
a personal guard.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.720
Oh, I'm not going to be
followed night and day.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.960
Kate, someone tried to kill
you, not Christofer.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.040
Oh, we've identified the assassin.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.520
Here he is.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.320
Miklos Constantinos.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.680
Born in Athens, 1985.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.840
Relieved of command
from the Hellenic Army 2010.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.680
Crops up as a mercenary with
pro-Gaddafi forces in 2011.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.720
Gun for hire.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.480
But one of the best.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.120
He's been invisible since 2019.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.840
If there's any connection to Libya,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.240
- then it's possible that he was...
- KATE SOBS

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.640
Oh, God.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.880
So, the question is...

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.520
The question is, who hired him?

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.720
But this is nothing to do with us.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.160
Please tell me this is absolutely
nothing to do with us!

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.200
We'd never be so stupid.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.480
If I wanted
Kate Lethbridge-Stewart dead,

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.280
I could do it
in the blink of an eye.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.960
You will watch your tone, sir.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.600
That woman serves this world in ways
we can never imagine.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.400
But still, we might be in trouble.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.520
We have links suggesting this man
was employed by

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.400
the Institute of Las Clementi -

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.080
the same people who sent
Ted Campbell on his mission.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.680
Ted Campbell had
stage four pancreatic cancer.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.840
Happy to give his life
for the Institute.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.320
But who are the Institute?

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.360
A private think-tank founded
and supported by billionaires.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.000
And their motives are clear.
The Great Replacement Theory.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.400
Terrified of Homo Aqua
replacing mankind.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.560
But they are literally
nothing to do with us!

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.200
That explosion, there is
no connection to us,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.000
not in any way, shape or form!

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.520
Is there?

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.560
I can close the Institute, going
in with force within two hours.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.520
Hand them over to Unit.
Case closed.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.280
Lethbridge-Stewart is safe.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.920
But one problem remains.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.560
Campbell was an associate
of Sir Keith Spears,

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.480
your greatest donor
and your very good friend.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.240
Yeah, but he's not part of it,
is he?

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.480
He's an idiot. The man's a clown!

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.520
No, but the problem is he invested
£100,000

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.480
in the Las Clementi Institute
in 2015.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.080
I don't imagine he's
connected to the explosion,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.400
not for a single second.
He's too much of a coward.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.560
But the authorities will
find the link,

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.920
and if they investigate
Sir Keith...

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.960
He is part of Severance.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.000
He automatically creates
a link back to us.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.800
Oh, my God.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.840
Exactly.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.080
We're connected.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.840
It's, erm, unlucky.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.000
Stupid man.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.480
What do we do?

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.680
Sir Keith Spears is a major investor
in the privatised water companies.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.480
A lot of people blame the water
companies for provoking the ocean.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.280
So?

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.680
Prime Minister,
all I need to know is,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.000
do you give me
permission to deal with this?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.560
With no connection to me?

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.760
With no connection to you.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.960
Then do it.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.800
They'll look after her.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.320
Where are they taking her?

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.320
Unit Tower. She'll be safe.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.960
They said that to us.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.680
Look at you, boss!

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.880
Come on, show some respect.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.600
- Mr Ambassador!
- All right.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.400
I was saying to the boys, "Two weeks
ago he was sitting in the office,

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.720
"signing off my overtime."
Now you're on TV.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.400
I said to the boys,
"I hope he's getting paid."

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.320
Yeah, no, I'm good,
I'm good, erm...

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.680
Yeah, I'm OK. Yeah. You know.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.960
Are you sure you're all right,
though, boss?

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.160
Cos that was kind of mad.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.080
They said you was right at
the bottom of the sea.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.360
It was, erm...

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.760
It was crazy, yeah.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.280
And she's in there? The fish?

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.240
Yeah.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.520
She's sushi, mate.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.200
CHUCKLING

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.000
That's, er...
That's kind of offensive, mate.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.760
Oh, no, but come on!
She murdered all those people.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.160
She's going straight to the lab

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.280
and she's going to be
sliced and diced.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.720
CHUCKLING

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.480
Er, I'm going to get back to
work, actually.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.600
Starting about now.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.040
Give me the keys
and I'll move her out.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.000
- Nah, I got this.
- No, I know you have.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.480
But, er, I can do it.
Just give me the keys, yeah?

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.920
- But they signed me on this.
- Yeah, but who clears the signatures?

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.800
That would be me.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.280
Come on, who's the boss?

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.920
He told me to give him the keys!

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.440
Barclay, what are you doing?

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.440
Barclay, stop and get out of there!

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.440
Hey, come on, man!
Don't get me in trouble!

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.520
Go, go!

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.440
- At arms!
- Get down! Get off the truck!

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.640
Barclay, this is not the solution.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.040
Now step down and I promise you
we can talk this through.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.120
We can talk with Salt, OK?
Just look around.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.080
There's no way you're going to
get through us!

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.720
Like you're going to shoot me
in front of the press!

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.640
- Like you're going to drive
right through them!
- Yeah?

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.320
Who said I was going forward?

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.600
Oh, my God! Don't blame me!

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.240
Barclay, don't, don't, don't!

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.000
Go down to the river.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.080
Spread out. Get me boats on
the water, now.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.040
Sorry, ma'am, we've got a problem.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.520
Barclay-bloody-Pierre-stupid
name-Dupont!

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.080
Breaking news now, with reports
that the only survivors

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.040
of the H2O tragedy are on the run.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.760
Oh, my God, he jumped!
He actually jumped!

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.000
Why did he do that?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.640
SPEAKS MANDARIN

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.440
Is Barclay Dupont a collaborator?
It certainly looks that way.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.160
The Americans have
taken down the Institute,

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.160
- so it looks like you're safe.
- Hmm.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.560
And if you don't stop work,
I'm going to phone your daughter

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.480
and get her to carry you out.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.760
She's in Dubai.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.440
Did she know about you
and Christofer?

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.840
I thought no-one did.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.800
For what it's worth, we were all
very happy for you.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.600
I'm so sorry.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.440
- I'll sign off.
- Where will you go?

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.240
Oh, hotel.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.800
I just need to get out.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.880
I'm sorry, ma'am? Morris was asking
if we should look into this?

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.400
Oh, it's a...
it's an act of terrorism.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.480
That's the police,
nothing to do with us.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.000
No. Wait.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.200
- Investigate.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.840
And with that, goodnight.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.200
ALARM BLARES

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.000
Sensors triggered at
the Thames Barrier!

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.040
- We've got life forms, ma'am!
- What life forms?

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.520
Incoming, straight from the Channel!

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.280
Good evening, everyone,
nice to be back.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.120
Nine life forms in total,
heading in our direction.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.520
Recall delegates, staff
and security to the Empress Hall.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.280
Priority One Standby.
Everyone on maximum alert.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.680
But who's the Ambassador?

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.320
Sir Jonathan is 40 minutes away.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.360
I'm trying Admiral Tavarez
but there's no reply.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.680
I'll do it.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.400
But you're exhausted.
You haven't had time to stop.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.840
- Are you saying I'm unfit for duty?
- Yes.
- Noted.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.800
We have eight Homo Aquaform
and one life form that's brand-new.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:15.040
Homo Amphibia, male presenting.
Body mass index 22.4.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.120
Blood pressure,
heart rate, both strong.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.320
Cortisol and adrenaline
off the scale.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.360
He's a warrior.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.800
My name is Kate Lethbridge-Stewart,
Commander in Chief

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.680
of the Unified Intelligence
Taskforce, but I stand

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.880
before you tonight on behalf of
the nations of the Earth with a...

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.360
Why are you all insane?

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.360
- Right.
- You came to our world...

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:48.600
..and killed yourselves to make
everything that is happening worse.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.160
Why in the name of the waters
would you do that?

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.720
Why are you beasts of such insanity?

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.960
- Page five, paragraph two?
- No, go to page six.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.040
- Try page 22, from the top.
- I, er...

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.440
- Oh, here we go.
- She's gone rogue.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.480
Even better.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.200
I can only say...

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.480
..that if you study
the culture of this world,

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.880
the thousands of years of fiction
and stories and science

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.920
and philosophy, and not one of us
can answer your question.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.880
We are a species whose intelligence
is running so fast,

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.320
it's 1,000 years ahead of
our emotions,

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.040
and that causes us to
stumble and fall,

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.560
time and time again.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.280
And I am sorry.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.440
I accept that response.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.480
And I'm addressing Ambassador...?

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.480
My name is a wave on the currents
through the coral and the sand,

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.520
but you might call me Tide.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.400
Ambassador Tide.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.080
Now, where is she?

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.920
- Who?
- Ambassador Salt.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.320
I...I can't say.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.120
She is your prisoner?

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.200
Technically.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.880
You must understand,

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.600
I ask this not in a bid for
her freedom.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.040
Then what do you want?

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:23.760
She chose to save a human life
and left Aquakind to die.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.880
We were murdered
while she helped him.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.840
Salt has transgressed against
the laws of our nature,

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.840
and the fate she must suffer

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.800
exists under the sea,
not upon the land.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.320
Now, I demand to know...

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.200
..where is she?

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.720
You've lost her?

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.040
With his help.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.120
What is it that binds
these two together?

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.080
We are trying to find them.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.840
But the problem is, Ambassador...

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.120
..if you intend to punish her,
I can't hand her over.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.320
Then yet again, we are at war.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.240
You're something of a warrior
yourself, and yet

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.240
full of despair.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.640
Despair that is new.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.800
I lost someone.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.720
That is good.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.200
You will strive to prevent
losses to come.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.920
Because we are tired of waiting.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.880
And if we have to escalate the war
between us, then we will.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.520
What does that mean?

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.240
You have met Salt.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.440
You have met Tide.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.040
Beware our third ambassador...

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.400
..Rust.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.680
Because water is not confined to
the seas.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.480
Water is in the air.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.200
And we can make a weapon of that
water to create rust.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.080
Eating at your cities
and cars and missiles,

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.080
until it brings your civilisation
down from rust

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.640
into dust.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.960
These negotiations are over.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.080
You will find Salt.
You will return her to us.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.800
You will advance the plans to
change your world

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.000
- within five years.
- That's impossible.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.400
Make it possible.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.440
One more thing.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.480
Yes?

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.800
Change the name.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.080
The name of what?

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.360
Earth.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.800
Too dry.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.560
- Oh, we got owned.
- We got rusted.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.960
We need to find Salt.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.640
Why?

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.080
We've tested the samples
but we've never tried Severance

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.000
on an adult Homo Amphibian.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.680
But they're leaders,
they're the prime species.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:35.160
If we can use Salt, I can
end this war...tomorrow.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.520
I reckon I've got dysentery.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.560
And E. coli,

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.720
and probably leprosy,
cos that river was filthy!

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.440
My neck...
Ah, it feels like it's been snapped.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.560
GLASS SHATTERS

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.280
Hey, oi, oi! What are you doing?!
What you doing?!

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.880
SHE CHUCKLES
Glass is fascinating!

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.520
Can you imagine, when we woke
and saw this world

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.560
with all its structures?

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.040
All right, well, just...
just mind your feet,

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.880
you don't want to get a cut.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.400
Oh, God!

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.000
You're always so scared.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Yeah, I am. I am terrified.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.600
You won't die. I cleaned you.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:31.240
Of protozoa. I took your breath
and my gills filtered the dirt.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.560
That's amazing.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.120
You do know you saved my life
down there,

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.840
when you kissed me?

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.360
Is that what you call a kiss?

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.680
The pressure of two orifices sealed
together in order to preserve

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.840
a hyperbaric shield for the
maintenance of your lung capacity?

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.200
Now, now, don't start talking sexy.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.920
- It is a good neck.
- Mm-hm.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.080
- Strong.
- Yep, yep.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.880
You should possess
gill-form lamellae.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:11.080
After all, you already
have very good fins.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.320
Is that a joke? Joke? That was...

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.920
That was a joke.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.400
I mean, wow, we're just...
on the run.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.440
People from both our worlds
chasing us

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.360
and she develops a sense of humour.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.480
I am liberated!

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.480
SHE EMITS HIGH-PITCHED TRILLING

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Salt! Salt, come on, come on!

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.480
We're supposed to be hiding!

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.120
It is ululation.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.760
- Do you not?
- No.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.440
TRILLING

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.640
God...!
HE YELPS

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.720
THEY YELP

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.480
What's it like, under the water?
Do you...? Do you have family?

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.760
We mate at random and spawn
in our thousands.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.480
But we're capable of more.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.920
We have happiness, we have anger,
we have love, we have...

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.800
Oh, we have the water, Barclay.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:19.760
We live in the water,
of the water, for the water,

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.800
with so much passion.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.480
We must look like apes to you.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.520
I mean, we are apes, clodding
about on the land like...

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.760
Well, like apes.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.720
You've been to the stars.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:39.360
You've mapped entire galaxies
in the sky.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.400
We never did that.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.720
Maybe we were too proud
of the water.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.240
Maybe it weighed us down.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.880
If you went back, what would happen?

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.840
What would they do to you? Aquakind.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.920
I would swim alone.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.200
Right, but just not, like,
executed or...?

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.880
Worse than that.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:14.520
I would swim alone, forever,
in the vastness.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.160
Like a shark?

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.240
A shark has a soul that is dead.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.160
I would live with a dead soul.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.480
I think you understand that.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.200
There's a loneliness in you.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.000
Yeah.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.400
You people are so...constructed.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.280
You apply fabric to your bodies,

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.400
leather on your feet.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.600
And you walk in the air with
such pomposity,

00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:00.240
but underneath, you burn
with animal heat.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.520
You're creatures of fire and doubt

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:10.240
and envy and fear and laughter
and lust and...

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.120
We watched you for so long,
under the sea.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.480
We could feel you,
burning on the land.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.560
I think we would have
always found you.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.680
Because your heat is irresistible.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.880
Is that fear?

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.760
What?

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.160
Your heartbeat.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.360
Racing.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.600
Er, it's not fear, exactly.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.760
Your heart is clamouring now.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.680
Yeah, yeah, of course, my heart.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:09.400
And my head, cos we were going
to die, 8km down.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.040
And I've got this ringing noise
in my ears, and this pain,

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.680
and when you created that hyperbaric
thing, everything just felt

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.480
so much better when you pressed
your lips against mine...

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.400
I find you unique.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.360
Oh, I really thought your skin
was going to be cold.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.560
I can regulate my body.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:42.320
- For you.
- Yeah, I'm sort of
regulating my body for you, too.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.040
So I see.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.200
Is that OK?

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.480
It's wonderful.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.480
SIREN WAILS

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:24.800
SHE SOBS

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.960
The name I chose was appropriate,

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.880
because you taste of salt.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.040
Well, you taste of, erm...

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.840
I don't know.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.880
Horizons.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.320
HELICOPTER PASSES

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.120
Are they searching for us?

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.440
The whole city's on red alert,

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.400
so, yeah,
I reckon they're looking for you.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.000
You work with the Army.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.080
Is there no-one you can trust?

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.000
Oh, I don't know.
My lot are tough.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.680
They're beyond the Army,
they're beyond the police.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.240
They're, like, at the top and if you
disobey the rules, you vanish.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.480
The woman in charge.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.240
Yeah, that's
Kate Lethbridge-Stewart.

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.880
She's a good soul.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.680
Yeah.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.720
How do you get to her?

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.440
You don't have to stay with me.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.360
You could just...

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.280
..swim away.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.720
The moment I enter the water,
they will know.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.000
They will find me.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
And they will punish.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.760
OK, er, options.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:13.760
So, we need to
get out of the city, right?

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.680
Because everyone's on red alert
and it's, like, lawless out there.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.200
You're public enemy number one,
so am I.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.680
We're going to get shot
in the street.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.000
So we need to find out. I mean...

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.960
Oh, hang on a minute, we could go
to North Wales.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.760
Cos I know some people there,
I know this guy there,

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.600
and he's done, like, five years
in the regular army.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.320
I mean, he'll hide us, he's
off grid. He's nuts, but at least

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.320
if we can get there, we can work out
what we can do next

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.320
and then, then, then, then we can
get a message to Kate,

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.080
cos we can...we can...we can talk
to her then, we can try.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.400
I can live in this North of Wales?

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.080
Oh, God, yeah. Yeah, it's got
lakes and waterfalls.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.600
- It's beautiful.
- I could live
in lakes and waterfalls.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.080
I could be the witch
of the waterfall!

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.880
Yeah, you could be the witch
of the waterfall. I just... Oh!

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.560
Live with me in the waterfall.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.440
But how would we get there?

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.200
Both the land and the sea
are closed to us.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.440
Yeah, and my phone's
probably tapped,

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.320
and the minute I make a call they're
going to know where we are.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.560
I just...

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.720
Did I mention to you that
it's lawless out there?

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.360
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi,
oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.760
I got you, I got you, I got you.
Come on, just calm down,

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.080
it's all going to be OK.
I just want your phone, mate.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.160
OK? Stop moving,
stop trying to run away,

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.560
or she will eat you alive, mate.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.760
She will eat you like bait, mate.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.640
Ain't that right, Monstro?
SHE HISSES

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.880
Hey, yeah. Oh...

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.840
Oh, hang on.
What's this? Here we go.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.920
What have you got on that,
face lock? Smile for the camera.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.160
Ah, thank you for your services
to king and country.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.480
If you tell anyone about this,
she will find you at midnight

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.960
and she'll eat you.
Go on, then, off you pop!

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.520
PANICKED YELLING

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.440
We're a good team.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.720
Shall I hiss again?

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.680
Er, no. We're done.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.800
So they are definitely going to be
monitoring my family phone,

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.240
but Kirby has got a second phone
in secret,

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.480
because Barbara, that's my ex,
insists on reading Kirby's texts -

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.320
says they're not old enough, which
drives Kirby mad -

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.960
so I did a dad thing on the sly,
just to buy favours,

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.520
and I got Kirby a second line.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.920
HE EXHALES
OK.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.200
PHONE BUZZES

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.000
- Hello?
- Kirby, it's me.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.600
Oh, my God!

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.840
Don't...say my name.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.800
I...I am so fine, I am OK,

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.600
- but I haven't got much battery on
this phone.
- Where are you?

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.720
You need to listen, we've got to be
really careful, love, OK?

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.960
Because they might have wired the
room. No, they-they-they will

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.400
definitely have wired the room,
so we've got to be so careful.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.800
- If I could, I just need
to speak to Mum.
- She's asleep.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:13.000
Erm, OK, just tell her to, er,
call me back on this number.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.280
But just tell her to call me from
the bathroom, OK?

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.800
Just tell her, do not talk in
public. Have you got that, Kirby?

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.120
Are you with HER?

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.880
I am. And it's good. I swear.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.280
I, er...I love you, Kirby.
I love you so much.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.960
Please?

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.960
- Mum?
- Yeah, love.
What is it? Are you OK?

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.080
So I need to borrow the car,
but I promise you,

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.360
you'll get it back. I mean, you
might not get it back straight away,

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.480
but you will definitely get it back.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.560
- I just need to get out of the city.
- And you're with...Salt?

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.440
Yeah, I'm sorry, I need to
protect her. Trust me.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.960
Please, it'll make sense. Now,
listen, they can't stop you leaving

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.360
the hotel, but you will need
a permit to drive across the city

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.240
in the car at night.
So if you go to my stuff,

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.760
there's a little leather folder
with a, like, a zip on it.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.400
- Do you know the one I mean?
- I've got it.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.760
You've got it? Right, so in there
is a permit, it's like a...

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.760
It's like a white card, it's got
red around the edges,

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.880
it's got a "U" in the middle of it.
If you just put that

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.400
in the windscreen, that will just
get you through anywhere.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.240
Erm, but where do you want me
to meet you?

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.040
Well, listen, most of the roads
have been closed off,

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.160
but you can get through
the Festival Bridge.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.600
Is that good, in, like, 30 minutes?

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.040
- I mean, we'll be coming from the
south side.
- You and her?

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.440
- Look, I promise you, I swear,
she's on our side.
- OK.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.800
We did it.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.720
Right.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.960
- Ma'am ...
- Oh, for God's sake!

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.760
- It's Barclay, ma'am.
- It bloody would be!

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.200
One hour's sleep. Thank you,
Mr Dupont. Now what have we got?

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.840
He made contact with his family.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.080
Rendezvous, Festival Bridge,
20 minutes.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.560
Captain Hannigan is taking a squad
from the north.

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.240
That's less than a kilometre
from here.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.800
You know Barclay, he trusts you. Go!

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.440
We've got Captain Khumalo
in St Saviour's.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.200
She's moving in to give us coverage
from the south.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.240
- And this is Barclay and Salt?
- Barclay and Salt, ma'am.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.040
Unit intercept Dupont
and the creature.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.160
SE1 8XT, grid 44 by 56.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.480
You have full authority.
Get me the amphibian.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.400
Move, move, move!

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.400
Ma'am, I've got confirmation!

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.720
- Not now!
- But Salt's confession is a
deepfake, just like we thought!

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.520
It's coded. Las Clementi.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.520
She never said those things.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.080
- This is a warning.
- Look, the video is fake.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.400
She's innocent.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.480
Oh, I can't tell.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.440
Is that the car?

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.800
Yes! It's her!

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.080
Come on!

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.440
Eyes on target.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.920
Corporal.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.640
What have you got? Sorry, Control,
I've got nothing to the south?

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.320
I thought we had Captain Khumalo
covering the south approach?

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.080
- Where's Captain Khumalo?
- Not getting a reply.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.920
Everything's gone quiet
south of the river.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.000
- What do you mean, quiet?
- Captain Khumalo? Can you report?

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.160
Captain...?

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.760
Targets sighted
and Captain Khumalo contained.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.680
Hold your positions.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.960
Barclay, run! It's a trap!

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.240
Run!

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.400
Go, go, go!

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.480
SIREN WAILS

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.520
We've got them! Go, go, go!

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.760
Who the hell are they?!

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.120
- General Gunsberg.
- He's intercepted our comms.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.960
General, this is a UNIT operation.
You will withdraw!

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.240
Complain to Geneva. We have
a war criminal on British soil.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.320
General Gunsberg, we have proof.
Salt is not a criminal.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.600
We'll happily examine that proof
in the morning.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.560
Right now we
have a murderer on the loose.

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.920
Barclay, stay where you are!

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.800
Both of you! DO! NOT! MOVE!

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.600
You'll both walk towards us!

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.000
You are prisoners
of the British Army.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.680
You will surrender to us!

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.680
General, you do not command
British troops.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.440
Whitehall has given me authority.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.120
We have a civilian on the bridge!

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.360
No, no, no, leave
her alone! Get off her!

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.880
Private comms to Sergeant Abrams.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.760
We don't actually need her alive.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.480
Her body is all we need.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.200
I can't let you do this.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.160
Unit troops, target soldiers.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.680
North axis, grid 49.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.560
What?!

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.400
Salt, go! Go to the river!

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.640
Go to the river!

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.440
Open fire at my command.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.360
On my command, fire at will.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.040
Those are British soldiers on
British soil! You wouldn't dare!

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.440
You'll wait a long time,
General, till I give way!

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.240
- Kate! Don't!
- On my command!

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.240
HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:03.640
ALL GROAN

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.320
Go.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.840
I'll find you, Salt! I'LL FIND YOU!

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.480
You'll never swim alone!
You'll never swim alone!

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.720
You will NEVER! SWIM! ALONE!
