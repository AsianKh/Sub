00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
{\an8}All over the world,
humanity reacts to the simple fact

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.840
the species that came before us
was woken up.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.200
The Unified Intelligence Taskforce
was created

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.640
to deal with alien life forms.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.080
I haven't got clearance.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.200
I am Grade Ten. I work in transport.
I'm a clerk.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.080
Almost.
SCREECHING

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.480
The first official meeting
with Homo aqua will begin here.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.920
My name is Kate Lethbridge-Stewart,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.560
Commander-in-Chief of
the Unified Intelligence Taskforce.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.640
And I hope this will be the start
of a great endeavour to find peace.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.040
We have a gift for you.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.920
My children.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.080
But they choked on your oil

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.880
and poison and excrement.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.480
I must state that
we recognise the problems...

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.680
You are not known to us.
We would speak...

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.560
..with him.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.720
{\an8}THUNDER CRACKS

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.240
{\an8}HELICOPTER WHIRS

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.640
- Ah...
- With me, please, sir.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.680
I suggest that this, um...meeting
is adjourned...

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.600
- ..while we, er...
- Follow me.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.840
..while we regroup.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.600
CHATTER

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.040
{\an8}His name's Barclay Pierre-Dupont.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.240
{\an8}He's a Grade Ten
who works in logistics.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.200
{\an8}- Family?
- Ex-wife and teenage child.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.280
{\an8}Bring them in,
put them in an interview room.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.360
{\an8}I want his file on my screen
by the time I get downstairs.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.400
Kate Lethbridge-Stewart.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.720
Yeah, I know. I book your taxis.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.800
Sit down.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.440
We weren't expecting this...
obviously.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.600
- Me, either.
- So help me understand.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.200
Out of nearly eight billion humans
on this planet,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.560
why do Homo aqua
want you as Ambassador?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.600
I don't know.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.280
What communications have you had
with Homo aqua prior to today?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.560
None.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.600
Never.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.960
I mean, I had a goldfish once.
Is that relevant?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.440
This isn't a joke, Mr Dupont.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.480
I'm not joking.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.360
He was called Simon.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.920
Right now, a team of experts
are trawling through

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.240
every detail of your private life.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.280
Every text message,
every email, every photo,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.040
everyone you've ever met.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.760
Barclay Pierre-Dupont,
born 15.11.82.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.960
- Get me his immediate family.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.840
Vehicles en route.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.800
Parents, deceased.
Married Barbara Nyamai, June 2003.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.480
Divorced November 2022.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.720
The split was amicable.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.440
Whatever he's done,
I'm not part of it.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.040
We're not even together!

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.640
I understand, ma'am. Sit down.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.920
Teenage child. Kirby, 16.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.080
Lives with the mother.
Studying A-levels.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.880
Seize all devices and bring them in
for questioning right now.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.800
My family have got nothing
to do with this.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.840
They don't even know I'm here.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.440
I never asked for this to happen,
OK?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.640
But I do want to help.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.800
And the thing is...

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.720
..you need me.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.760
Am I right?

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.320
Well, am I right?

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.160
The first day
of H2O diplomacy

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.200
{\an8}has concluded
with an abrupt change of ambassador.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.680
REPORTERS CLAMOUR

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.000
Sir Jonathan Hynes has made
no comment over his dismissal,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.920
and the identity of the new
ambassador has been suppressed.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.960
This man is the most important
person on the planet.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.920
Don't we have a right
to know who he is?

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.680
{\an8}We cannot allow a foreign species
to dictate our diplomacy process.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.880
This is dangerous.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.480
- Prime Minister.
- The H20 Committee
will not allow a random civilian

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.920
- to represent them.
- Kate, you're to
go back in that room and tell her.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.920
We choose our Ambassador and
the Committee's decision is final.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.320
I'd do it myself,
but it doesn't look good, does it,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.040
if I'm the one in there
when war breaks out?

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.920
Not when you can blame UNIT.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.320
Sorry.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.880
That's not what I meant.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.760
Look, maybe it's better
woman-to-woman.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.640
If that's what she is.
Is that what she is?

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.320
HE STAMMERS

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.000
Please, Kate.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.480
We're relying on you.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.680
Thank you for
this unscheduled consultation.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.000
I am Kate Lethbridge-Stewart,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.040
Commander-in-Chief of
the Unified Intelligence Taskforce

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.480
and representative
of the H2O Committee.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.400
The Committee has requested
urgent action

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.560
regarding the role
of Human Ambassador.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.240
Rather than appoint this civilian,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.040
they request that you trust
in our original candidate.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.360
You talk of trust...

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.880
..while meeting in secret.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.240
In the dark.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.480
We would hear from the Ambassador.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.400
Mr Dupont is unprepared.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.320
We would hear...

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.400
..from the Ambassador.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.320
Come closer.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.840
Hello.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.000
Um...

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.400
Do...do you have a name?

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.000
Is that a thing?
Cos...I'm Barclay.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.080
It's Scottish.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.560
Well, my...my gran was...
my gran was Sc...Scottish.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.520
My title will not translate.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.480
But you may call me Salt.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.680
Salt.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.160
Hi.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.280
Listen, I'm just a regular guy.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.720
I work in an office.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.560
I don't know about diplomacy
or politics.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.040
I don't even own a decent suit...

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.440
We chose you for your humanity
and compassion,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.880
not your expertise.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.680
Your leaders would replace you.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.200
But what do you want?

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.440
I'm...I'm fine with whatever
they decide.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.520
No.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.000
What do you really think?

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.760
I think...

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.960
..this process is about everybody,
right?

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.880
The whole world.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.560
It's not just prime ministers
and presidents,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.080
it's real people, like me, who worry
about their bills and their kids.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.160
I mean, I'm a nobody.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.600
I get it, but I think...

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.880
..maybe it's time people like me
had more of a voice.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.160
We hear you...

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.920
..Ambassador.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.840
It is decided.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.880
Your request has been heard
and denied.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.800
Barclay will be present
at dawn tomorrow,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.720
or negotiations will end.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.320
Oh, no.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.920
Where are you taking me?

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.800
Huh?

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.280
What about my family?

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.000
Please, I don't want to be shot.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.840
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.360
Are you going to kill me?

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.520
I forgot my gun.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.720
Really?

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.760
No.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.960
DOOR SLAMS SHUT
Ah!

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.280
Look, look, look, look,
I'm not a spy or a collaborator.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.760
And I wasn't disrespecting anyone,
if that's how it sounded, all right?

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.040
And my mouth,
it just goes on autopilot.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.040
I mean, the same thing happened
when I proposed to my ex.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.440
- It took me about 20 minutes
to get to the ring...
- Barclay.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.040
I need someone I can work with.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.200
Well, yeah, of co...

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.400
Of course you do, yeah.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.240
And I think I can work with you.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.200
What?

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.640
Wait, hang on, I mean...

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.560
About five minutes ago,
you were trying to get rid of me.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.440
I have to tread carefully.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.720
All UNIT wants
is a peaceful settlement,

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.920
but there are levels and levels
of politics at play here,

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.120
international rivalries
that go way back.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.760
The truth is, I've spent my whole
life fighting for this planet.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.160
Now, with your help...

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.880
..I get to build a better world
for every one.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.120
I don't want to let you down.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.840
I mean, I keep thinking
about the time I mixed up the taxis

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.360
- and you ended up in...
- Splott. I remember.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.840
But Homo aqua
chose you for a reason...

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.840
..and I'm prepared
to give you a chance.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.360
OK, er...

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.120
..so what happens now?

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.160
Now...

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.000
..your life changes.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.080
SIREN WAILS

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.040
The Ambassador's transport
now arriving at diplomatic hotel.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.440
Clear the corridors.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.840
SHUTTER CLICKS

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.920
Security protocols.
All delegates and diplomatic staff

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.480
are being relocated
for their own safety.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.520
But for how long?
And what about my family?

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.600
Can I call them?

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.920
- Barclay!
- Dad!

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.160
- Hey-eh.
- What the hell's going on??

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.680
I know, I know, I know, I know.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.480
Barclay will be present at dawn
tomorrow or negotiations will end.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.400
"We hear you."
That's what she said to him - we.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.760
And if that's true, how was
she communicating with her people?

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.040
Maybe she's wearing an implant.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.760
Well, they could have
shared consciousness.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.240
Or some kind of mycorrhizal network.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.800
Well, maybe they've mastered sound
in a way we don't understand,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.000
using frequencies
we can't even hear.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.040
Like Mariah Carey.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.080
SHE LAUGHS

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.800
I noticed something earlier, when
Sir Jonathan presented the flower.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.240
Everyone focused on her, but look.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.200
The exact moment she inhales...

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.000
..they all do,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.360
even the ones in the water

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.040
She's softening her language.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.840
She used sarcasm,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.000
like she's learning, adapting.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.200
They want an everyman as Ambassador.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.240
But is that what she is?
Cos she's extraordinary.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.640
Those remains
are en route to the lab.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.960
And the H20 Committee
are kicking off.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.960
They want to see you.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.560
So we're just accepting
her choice of Ambassador?

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.280
What if he's not up to it?

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.880
Their race has survived
under the sea for millennia

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.960
with centuries
of social, evolutionary

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.600
and technological advantage.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.160
She's running this show,
whether we like it or not.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.040
Evening.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.960
- Didn't think you were in tonight.
- DOOR CLOSES

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.520
I volunteered.
Didn't want to miss this.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.960
- Let's prep one for imaging.
- Mm-hm.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.360
Careful.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.080
We'll take tissue samples.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.600
Prep some slides.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.120
MACHINE HUMS

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.880
But you...you work in admin.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.720
You're not an Ambassador!

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.640
You couldn't even
finish your wedding speech!

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.800
- Only cos your dad spilt wine
all over it.
- Ugh!
- On purpose!

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.520
So you're literally the person
they're talking about on TV?

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.720
- Like, all the time.
- Yeah, but you can't say a word.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.000
- Not to anyone.
- Who are we
going to tell? We're prisoners!

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.640
But Dad is famous.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.480
OK, just look on the bright side,
look at the view.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.720
That's... It's nice.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.440
And this room, it's amazing,
isn't it? It's huge.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.160
Am I the only person
living in the real world right now?

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.240
What about work and school?

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.120
Kirby's got that coach trip
on Thursday.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.320
- A coach trip?!
- Yeah.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.040
Oh, I'm glad
you've got your priorities in order.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.440
Never mind the massive
international crisis!

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.440
Er, no, I'm not sure
the minibar's included.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.480
Sue me.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.680
So, if you're an Ambassador,

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.480
does that mean you get to make,
like, actual decisions?

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.720
No. God, no.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.880
They've got like this whole
committee who writes everything,

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.480
does the policy.
I just have to read it out.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.480
But then, like, why you?

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.920
I don't know.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.760
- She just chose me.
- What's she like?

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.760
Well...

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.840
..I mean, she's kind of like us,
but she's...

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.200
Like, I don't know.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.600
- She's beautiful.
- "Beautiful"?

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.880
- Yeah.
- She's a fish.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.400
She's not a fish.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.520
She's not a fish,
and she's not a person.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.800
She's something else.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.440
- Anyway, I'm not even supposed to
be talking about this.
- Convenient.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.240
Barbara, do you...do you really
think I asked for this?

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.720
I have no idea,

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.800
because it turns out my ex-husband,

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.320
- who can't even assemble flat-pack
furniture...
- Furniture, God.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.720
..is a secret agent who lied about
his job and is now saving the world!

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.240
So excuse me if I have questions.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.120
I'm making the most
of this massive bath.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.480
HE SIGHS

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.200
DOOR SLIDES SHUT

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.440
We're putting an enormous amount
of pressure on one man.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.480
I hope he's up to it.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.960
My father taught me
to rely on instinct over intel.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.440
Trust my gut.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.840
He'd say...

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.200
HE SPEAKS ARABIC

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.240
He sounds very wise, your dad.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.800
He is.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.240
You should meet him.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.600
What does your instinct say?

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.720
Oh, I've seen ordinary people
achieve extraordinary things.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.880
But they're usually travelling
with The Doctor.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.840
And Barclay has you...by his side.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:41.240
The oceans cover 71%
of this planet's surface.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.320
The human race
is quite literally surrounded.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.680
And if it comes to war...

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.440
..I wonder if
we even stand a chance.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.440
Let me take your mind off it.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.240
Are those tissue samples ready?

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.440
Yep, two seconds.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.200
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.880
THUNDER RUMBLES

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.720
You're late.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.000
Your citizenship is approved.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.440
Welcome to Britain.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.560
What about my mother?

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.040
Hey! What about my mother?!

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.240
THUNDER RUMBLES

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.600
Thanks, Maria. Hello, darling.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.120
Can't stop. Gallery opens Friday
and Sue's got Covid.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.000
- It's been chaos.
- OK. Fill me in later, yeah?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.960
Yeah. Oh, your guests -
they're waiting in the dining room.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.600
Generals, sorry to keep you.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.080
Hey, take your time.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.360
Look at this spread.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.040
Homo aqua tissue samples.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.160
Know thine enemy.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.360
Oh, I haven't eaten all day.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.920
We know what they're
going to ask for, right?

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.920
HE CHUCKLES
What do we do?

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.880
Don't worry. Leave the fish to us.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.680
It'll be the death
of the energy industry.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.240
Of your livelihood.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.360
We've run simulations.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.960
Look at the impact of wars and
the pandemic on Western economies

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.680
and multiply that by a hundred.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.480
We'll be sliding into recession.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.640
The public are already panicked.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.960
My mother was in the bank today,
emptying her account.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.320
Yeah, which one?
THEY CHUCKLE

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.520
The President's sole focus
is to protect

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.040
the stability of the US economy.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.280
Mine is to protect my companies.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.960
That's what we hoped you'd say.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.120
But, with UNIT running
the diplomacy,

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.600
there's constant opposition.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.680
Hmm. Kate Lethbridge-Stewart
has influence -

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.840
with the H2O Committee

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.840
and with your Prime Minister.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.440
Not to worry. Harry's attentions
are divided at the moment,

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.880
and he always listens
to his biggest donor.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.320
Good.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.040
We'll need you onside
when we brief him.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.320
Oh, you had me at recession.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.640
THEY LAUGH

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.920
PHONE PINGS

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.720
Oh, shi...

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.840
REPORTERS CLAMOUR

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.680
How's he on the news?

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.280
He's supposed to be a secret.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.000
The H2O
Diplomacy Committee

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.240
are denying all interview requests.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.160
The only thing we do know
about Barclay Pierre-Dupont,

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.560
our new Ambassador,
is that the world is watching.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.520
- Copy that.
- The route is clear.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.680
The route is clear.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.960
Go on, Dad!

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.040
KEYPAD BEEPS

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.480
Morning, Colonel. Mrs Bingham.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.960
- Commander.
- What do we know about the leak?

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.880
The photo was emailed to the press
by an anonymous source.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.640
Except I've cross-matched the image
with CCTV from the hotel.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.720
The photographer was
General Dominique Dussolier,

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.080
the French representative.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.600
Quelle surprise!

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.520
She's been undermining Nato
since she first drew breath.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.120
And if she discredits UNIT,

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.240
she gets more influence
over the H20 Committee.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.120
Get the French Ambassador
on the phone.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.640
I'm in the mood for a bollocking.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.120
Press Association is still
demanding access to the Hall.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.680
I'm not sure
we want to get them offside.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.960
Fine, let them in. But no live TV.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.360
50 people maximum, and anyone
who steps out of line gets barred.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.600
I'm sorry, General Dussolier, your
access to the hall has been revoked.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.840
Come with us, please.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.480
C'est inadmissible.
Vous pouvez pas me refuser l'entree.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.720
Just stick to the text
on your screen and you'll be fine.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.520
Keep your body language and your
vocal tone neutral at all times.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.880
No crossed arms, no raised voice,
no sign of aggression or impatience.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.520
Everything you say or do or think
has to come through us.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.720
What's the point of being Ambassador
if all I'm doing is reading?

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.960
There is a team of 43 people

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.280
working round the clock
on this document -

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.360
UN diplomats and wartime negotiators
vetting every last syllable.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.040
Prime ministers,
presidents, royalty.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.920
Frankly, it's a miracle
we got past the contents page.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.480
You cannot go rogue.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.880
- Are we ready?
- We're all behind you.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.040
Well, yeah, literally.
I'm the one standing up there.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.080
You can do this.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.080
Oh, God.
HE EXHALES HEAVILY

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.600
I can't stop shaking.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.240
Tell the press no camera flashes,
and keep an eye on Barclay's obs.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.280
Blood pressure 138 over 90.
Bit high.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.240
Pulse is 82 and steady.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.560
Is Downing Street online?

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.440
- Prime Minister?
- Yes, we're here.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.160
All right. Good luck, everyone.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.760
Mrs Bingham?

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.520
Open seals.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.160
WHIRRING

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.160
Ambassador, are you OK?

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.800
Ambassador?

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.080
- Barclay?
- Mm? Yeah?

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.800
Oh, sorry.
Yes, yes, yes, I'm here. It's me.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.280
Hello again.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.200
That's not scripted.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.560
Barclay.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.120
Sorry.
HE CLEARS THROAT

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.960
I bid you welcome, Ambassador,

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.720
and bring to session
this diplomatic congress.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.200
On behalf of all nations,
I would like to say...

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.320
..how sorry I am
about your children.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.520
Are you a parent?

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.200
Yes, yes, he's a parent.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.920
Teenage child, Kirby.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.320
Barclay, just say yes.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.360
Yes.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.880
I can't imagine
what that was like for you.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.840
Your apology is appreciated.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.960
Now back to the text, please.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.640
We begin today by hearing proposals
to formalise our peace treaty.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.320
But first...

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.520
..we request...

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.480
..a glass of water.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.240
Um, is...

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.960
Well, it's... Is...is that...?

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.320
Can we?

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.320
Water from the river.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.120
From the river?

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.160
What? They drink river water?

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.760
Barclay, read the screen.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.240
Er, we will arrange that
immediately.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.800
Go, go, go!

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.760
SIREN WAILS

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.600
Move, let's go! Come on!

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.800
If, er, I could return
to the agenda, we'd like...

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.000
We will wait.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.480
OK.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.280
Oh, OK. They...they said OK.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.040
Defensive formation.
In and out, quick as you can.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.480
Keep your eyes on the water!

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.120
{\an8}Don't turn your back,
not for one second.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.040
The glass requires decontamination.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.320
Shall I place it in the airlock?

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.200
The water is not for us.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.920
It is for you.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.760
Sorry... Sorry, I don't...
I don't understand.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.040
You will drink it.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.280
Hold on, Barclay.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.000
Get me intel on that water.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.640
You...will...drink.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.920
Er...

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.560
Just, like, actually drink it?

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.160
E. coli's guaranteed.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.760
Dysentery, meningitis
and Legionnaires' disease.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.360
Barclay, do not drink the water.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.760
But what do I say?

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.920
Stand by.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.080
Um, with respect,
I am unable to drink this.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.400
Why?

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.640
- The water is contaminated.
- Why?

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.440
She knows why.
Skip to 16, paragraph 12.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.280
We're aware of the current
pollution crisis and are putting...

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.840
These are the words
of a politician -

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.160
vetted and craven and hollow.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.840
You would answer.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.000
Barclay, stick to the script.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.320
Barclay.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.480
Ambassador, refer to your screen.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.440
Why?

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.840
Barclay, no!

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.760
Because we were stupid.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.840
That's the truth of it.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.400
And the whole planet's
going to hell right now

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.280
because we didn't understand
the consequences.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.920
But now you do.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.200
Yeah.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.600
Yeah, now we do.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.840
This is too risky.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.080
No, wait.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.160
Still, every day,
water companies are pumping poison

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.680
and sewage into our rivers
and oceans,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.720
all the while dishing out bonuses
to their bosses.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.400
And the thing is, we are
letting them get away with it!

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.800
We're just sat at home, flicking
through our phones, making tea,

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.200
thinking it's
someone else's problem!

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.400
But it's not. This is my fault.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.320
We all played our part.
Now we have to help fix it.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.400
And the thing is,
our kids know this!

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.320
Our kids.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.720
They're way ahead of us!

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.000
Why aren't we listening?

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.280
Well, today's the day we start.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.400
I think you are my favourite human.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.600
HE LAUGHS INCREDULOUSLY

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.600
CROWD CLAMOURS

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.120
Come on.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.480
Oh, I feel amazing!

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.960
I'm sorry, but...but I do.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.440
It's like...it's like I want to run.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.960
I just want to...
I just want to run for miles.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.920
- I've got so much energy right now!
- Run!

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.080
- What?
- You're ridiculous.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.040
- You know, I was thinking
about you today.
- Me?

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.640
When I was standing up there
like a lemon,

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.400
I was thinking about
all those things you'd told me,

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.440
- you and your hippy mates.
- Well, they're not hippies,

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.040
and that's not even a word any more,
so...

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.040
Well, I just wish
that I'd listened sooner.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.080
But I'm listening now,
I promise you.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.560
- Who even are you?
- Oh!
- I don't know, but I like it.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.000
You're on telly again.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.640
You're always on telly, aren't you?

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.440
They're calling you passionate.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.720
- "Passionate"!
- Yeah, that's me.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.320
You haven't been passionate
since Christmas 2010.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.600
- Oh, oh!
- Oi, Oi!

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.560
THEY LAUGH
I need a drink.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.400
Here. Tastes better
than river water.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.080
Mm.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.000
Do you know,
it just hit me just now.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.200
This is history in the making.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.680
Right now. And I'm part of it.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.480
I'm a...I'm a historical figure.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.160
- It's crazy, isn't it?
- OK.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.720
So what's she like, then,
your fishy ambassador?

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.040
- Are you jealous?
- Please!
- She is.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.280
You are. You're jealous.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.360
Can we order room service now?

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.600
Sure.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.360
I'll have the fish.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.600
The H2O Committee have prepped new
models for environmental regulation.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.320
The Greens have been trying to
achieve these targets for decades.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.880
That timeframe will be a challenge.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.400
The H2O Committee consulted
with industry on that.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.840
Moving on, the French consulate
have lodged an official complaint

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.920
over General Dussolier's
removal from the hall.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.360
- They want her reinstated.
- Tough. They've seen the evidence.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.960
She's denying it,
and she has influence.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.040
I think it'd be dangerous
to shut her out.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.600
Fine. Fine.
We've got bigger problems.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.280
Meanwhile, we've been debating
communication theories,

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.800
how the Homo aqua Ambassador
is able to send

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.560
and receive information
seemingly instantaneously.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.560
Yeah, we're looking into
oceanic mycelium networks.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.400
Mycelium? Well,
that's the mushrooms, right?

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.800
Mushrooms are the reproductive
organs of mycelium networks.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.880
Wait, I'm eating
reproductive organs on my toast?

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.400
Mycelium networks
are the fungal threads

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.760
believed to connect
individual plants and trees

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.680
to share and recycle vital minerals.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.400
A lot of these theories
are debatable.

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.080
Yes, I know. But if algae and fungi
interact in a similar way

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.200
when in water, or if water itself
forms some kind of network...

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.800
Homo aqua, Amphibia, Grandis -

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.280
all these species could
potentially be interconnected.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.840
Like a hive mind?

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.760
What if the pearl
is their connection point?

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.840
Or filter.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.440
God, they're so far ahead of us,
it's difficult to comprehend.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.040
We're literally children
playing guessing games.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.240
DEVICE PINGS

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.360
Dad?

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.760
Couldn't sleep?

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.680
Thank you.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.000
I just read your big speech again.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.320
Mm-hm?

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.880
It's more of a ramble.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.360
It made me...
It me made me proud, though.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.440
Really?

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:09.840
But, with all the attention,
are you going to be safe doing this?

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.480
- Yeah, course.
- Do you promise?
- Yes.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.880
Promise.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.160
They're moving you
out of here tomorrow,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.240
putting you in a proper safe house,
away from all this.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.320
OK?

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.560
I'd rather stay here with you.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.640
The whole world's changing, Dad.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.360
Well, maybe it needed to.

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.840
Maybe it's for the best.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.720
Your family will be moved
to a safe house this morning.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.840
We're separating civilians
from diplomatic staff.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.200
I know. Can I see them
before they go?

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.640
- No, sorry, you're here all day.
- Barclay, hi. Rose-Marie Hunt.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.720
- Nice suit.
- No interviews.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.720
What can you tell us
about Homo aqua's demands?

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.360
How confident are you
that we can achieve what they want?

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.320
How are you coping
under the pressure?

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.600
And what happens
if you mess this up?

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.560
Hiya.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.000
Text on screen, please.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.760
Once again, I bid you welcome.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.200
And bring to session
this diplomatic congress.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.120
World leaders have consulted
with climate scientists

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.800
and private enterprise
on the subject of ocean pollution.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.680
We can guarantee a 50% reduction
by 2065.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.880
Further reduction
will then be exponential.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.000
2065?

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.680
Correct.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.800
50%.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.080
Yes.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.880
Explain.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.400
It will take time
to raise the finance and resources

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.760
to tackle the problem,

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.880
but world governments are committed
to making it a priority.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.960
40 years?

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.280
Yes.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.280
This is unacceptable.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.640
An operation of this scale

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.080
will stretch our resources
to their limits.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.880
We regret we cannot guarantee
a significant reduction

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.400
of ocean pollution
in a shorter timeframe.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:50.000
So this is your final offer?

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.600
You've waited millions of years
beneath the ocean.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.280
Now we are asking
for just 40 more years to reset,

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.840
to give you what you want.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.200
You are asking...

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.280
..for 15,000 revolutions
of the Sun...

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.680
..when scores of us
are dying every day.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.800
Should we wait...

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.320
..while your engines deafen us...

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.400
..while your trawlers
ravage our home...

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:26.120
..while we choke on your plastic
and sewage?

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.080
We cannot hear,

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.080
or see,

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.800
or breathe.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:39.200
So tell me why we should live
like this

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.480
for just one day longer.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.520
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.560
I believe that you are sorry.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.720
But are your leaders?

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.720
The world is united in its desire
for meaningful change.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.400
Do they wish...

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.200
..that they could
achieve this sooner?

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.200
Yes, of course.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.400
Do they want...

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.200
..to accelerate this process?

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.800
We are committed
to undoing the damage

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.600
we have inflicted on our planet.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.720
How committed?

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.440
It is our greatest desire.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.040
Then we shall grant it.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.360
Sorry, what do you mean?

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.840
Your greatest desire...

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.600
..is happening.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.520
THUNDER RUMBLES

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.040
CRASHING, RUMBLING

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.480
What's happening?

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.040
I don't know.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.760
RUMBLING, CRASHING

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.560
Do you hear that?

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.080
Is it a storm?

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.480
That's no storm.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.480
It's plastic.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.000
Mum... Mum!

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.520
Oh, my God!

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.160
PEOPLE SCREAM

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.920
Turn the car around.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.960
Turn it around! Get us out of here!

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.760
It's happening everywhere
all at once.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.120
The plastic's coming out of
the oceans into our cities.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.240
It's not just the oceans,
it's coming out of the Thames,

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.560
out of the Nile, the Hudson.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.640
Lock down the building.
Get everyone to the lower levels.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.920
Quick as you can. Come on.
Come on, move it!

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.240
- Stop looking! Come on, clear
the room!
- Keep going, keep going!

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.760
Barclay, we need to leave.
Right now. Come on.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.520
Now!

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.880
You have to stop!

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.800
We are cleaning up your mess!

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.600
PHONE RINGS

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.760
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait.
You OK?

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.400
Barclay, what's happening??

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.600
They're cleaning up the ocean - the
plastic, the pollution, all of it.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.040
- They're giving it back.
- We're in a car, it's chaos.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.240
- What? You're outside?!
- We can't get to the safe house.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.280
- We can't cross the river.
- Oh, for God's sake!

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.680
Just... Just, er... Just...

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.040
Just come to the hall.
Tell the driver it's Imperial House.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.640
Imperial House.
Can you take us to Imperial House?

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.120
ENGINE ROARS, TYRES SQUEAL

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.760
- There's nowhere to go!
- Don't worry, OK?

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.840
We're getting out...

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.960
THEY YELP

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.040

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.120
Kirby, listen to me.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.480
We have to run for it,
but I need to help the driver.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.320
- Is he...? Is he...?
- No, don't look at him! Listen!

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.480
Get out and run in there
and find your dad.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.720
I'll be right behind you.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.960
Promise me! Just run!

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.760
- I-I promise.
- Go!

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.440

We're here.

the sky is raining plastic.

Police have issued a directive.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.720
The streets are not safe.
Everyone should stay indoors.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.200
Do not go outside.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.240
What have they done?

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.760
They're declaring war.

World leaders have called for calm
as the clean-up operation begins.

Major cities around the world
remain paralysed,

Every citizen of this planet
is now at war!

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.640
It is time to unite

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.680
against the common enemy, Homo aqua.

why do Homo aqua want
you as ambassador?

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.200
- We would hear from the Ambassador.
- Find Kirby!

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.640
All we want
is a peaceful settlement.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.880
- We would hear from the Ambassador!
- They're declaring war.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.440
- She's a fish.
- Barclay?

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.480
You work in admin,
you're not an ambassador!

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.680
Keep your body language and your
vocal tone neutral at all times.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.280
Everything you say or do
has to come through us.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.800
Barclay?

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.080
We are cleaning up your mess!

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.680
Barclay!

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.520
Ambassador...

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.600
..we approached
this congress in good faith,

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:28.200
but your actions have jeopardised
the diplomatic process.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.960
Humanity wants
a peaceful settlement, not war.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.760
This war began a long time ago,

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.160
and it was started by you.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.000
Now we have simply returned
what is yours.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.760
HE SIGHS

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.440
Look, there's words here
I'm supposed to say,

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.000
but the fact is you're cleverer
than we are. That's obvious.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.560
- He's off script again.
- This is like
working with the Doctor!

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.680
Look, I understand why you did this.
Really I-I do.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.120
But it was a mistake.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.200
People were hurt.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.040
And my family were out there,
and they could've died!

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.080
Now things are worse.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.120
We're scared.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.600
When humans are scared,
they do terrible things.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.760
Are you threatening us?

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.480
No, no. No, no, no.
No, definitely not, no. I'm sorry.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.800
I'm sorry. No, I'm not.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.480
Enough, Barclay. I mean it, or
God help me, I'll come down there.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.800
Get back to the text.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.800
The United Nations of the Earth
demand an armistice agreement,

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.600
with immediate effect,
for the duration of these talks

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:39.120
to safeguard humanity and protect
a path towards long-term peace.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.280
There will be three conditions.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.040
One, that pollution of oceans

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.160
and waterways ceases
with immediate effect.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.040
We were expecting this.
Addendum two, paragraph one.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.120
World governments are working
with industry

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.000
on urgent solutions
to this crisis.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.800
Our second requirement
is formal designation of borders.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.840
Prepared for that too.
OK, this is good.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:04.880
We are happy to consider
large areas of all seas

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.680
that are exclusive to Homo aqua.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.480
Areas are not acceptable to us.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.200
We require all water.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.280
What does she mean? Clarify that.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.800
Sorry, all water?

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.760
The entirety of all oceans
and waterways.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.480
Sorry. Excuse me.
We're an island nation.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.840
Are we permitted passage
across the oceans?

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.000
No.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.560
The human race
evolved to live on land,

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.040
not in the waters or the sky.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.880
She said sky.
D-Do they want the skies now?

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.640
You live in the ocean.
The skies are not your concern!

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.080
The air above the ocean
is the ocean.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.200
This is our space.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.560
Are you seeking to ground
all air transport?

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.000
Transport over land is your concern.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.160
Transport across water
will not be permitted.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.280
But that's ridiculous!

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.760
Barclay, you're losing control.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.160
Trade between continents
is an essential function

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.200
of the modern world!

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.920
Yes! Our continent
relies on food imports!

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.280
We will take questions
from the Ambassador.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.680
- Barclay...
- There's no prep for this.
We don't have responses.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.960
You are amphibian!
You don't own the sky!

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.560
You cannot starve our people!

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.760
We will take questions from
the Ambassador!

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.920
- You're holding us hostage!
- What about the Channel Tunnel?

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.720
The world cannot function
without cross-continental travel.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.920
How dare you!
How dare you come in here

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.280
and dictate the future
of the human race!

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.280
You are condemning developing
countries to death!

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.400
ENOUGH!
FEEDBACK ECHOES

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:43.400
We will take questions
from the Ambassador only.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.400
- Whoa.
- Voice has changed.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.760
Her intonation is...male.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.960
Never mind the voice.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.560
Look at him.

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.800
I'm getting spikes in testosterone,
cortisol and ketotestosterone.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.360
What, so she's a man now?

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.120
- I...
- I don't know.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.600
Sorry.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.320
They... Th-They're sorry.
They'll... They'll shut up.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.800
Sit...down...

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.600
..and shut up!

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.640
- How's she doing that?
- Incredible.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.720
Like I said, people are scared.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.680
They fear what
they don't understand.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.880
They don't mean to offend.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.880
Well done, Barclay.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.800
We'll need time.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.240
These proposals aren't something
we can solve in days or weeks,

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.720
or even months.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.800
But while we negotiate,

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:59.240
we insist on a formal armistice to
maintain peace between our species.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.080
We have given two conditions
for this armistice.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.240
There is a third.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.520
And it is simple.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:13.160
We stand here
in your rooms of concrete and steel

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.000
and dust and light,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.200
burning our eyes and our lungs...

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.440
..and we will endure no more.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.080
So our next meeting...

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.360
..will be here...

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.720
- Atlantic Ocean.
- How are they doing this?

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.360
Check those co-ordinates.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.480
North of the Equator,
just off the coast of West Africa.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.680
Is it an island?

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.240
- No.
- They want to meet on a ship?

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.040
What's the third co-ordinate?

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.920
South, west... What's M?

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:54.000
Barclay, that's open water. Please
clarify the third co-ordinate.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.720
Your metric unit
for length and depth.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.760
You would like us to meet...

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.160
..underwater?

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.840
You talk of peace and equality.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.560
So prove your commitment...

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.760
..and meet us in our world.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:16.120
Romanche Trench, one of the deepest
waterways on the planet.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.160
25,000 feet. Five miles down.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.040
Manned submersibles have
imploded in less than half that.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.200
Barclay, don't agree to anything.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.840
Will you meet us, Barclay,
at the bottom of the ocean?

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.120
OK.
