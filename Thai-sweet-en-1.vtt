00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.440
Guess who I am.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.720
You must be...

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.280
Mu?

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.440
That's right.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.160
Do you prefer independent travel
or group tours?

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.200
Independent travel.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.000
Do you prefer juice or coffee?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.880
Coffee.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.340
You're following me on purpose,
aren't you?

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.240
Call him now.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.600
Okay.

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.440
Hello.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.400
We're about to arrive in Thailand.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.560
We're about to arrive in Thailand.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.200
Can you come pick us up?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.640
What?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.730
Let's order some drinks first.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.160
Hello.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.420
Hello, sir, what would you like to drink?

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600
Two iced Americanos.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.120
Sure.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.840
Great, thank you.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.440
Hello, your coffee is ready.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.280
This cafe serves orders really quickly.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.340
These came out right after I ordered.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.960
Hello.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.320
Didn't we agree to pretend?

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.120
Then why'd you say hello when you came in?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.360
Turn around.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.560
I'll walk in again.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.280
Now I'm supposed to

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.680
pretend I didn't know
she was coming, right?

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.280
Or what am I supposed to do?

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.160
Guess who I am.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.600
You must be...

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.320
Mu?

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.000
You must be...

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.720
Mu?

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.560
Mu?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.720
That's right.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.080
Long time no see.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.960
Long time no see.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.880
Is this the gift you prepared for me?

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.360
This is the gift I prepared for you.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.820
It's not Lightning, is it?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.040
How could I bring a live animal?

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.160
What's this?

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.680
This is...

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.480
Open it.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.010
I'm opening it then.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:19.920
A helmet!

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.000
I could tell just by looking at

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.920
the edges of it.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.560
Long time no see.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.520
Me or the helmet?

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.440
You!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.240
I've never seen this helmet before.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.040
Now...

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.000
You don't already have it, right?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.280
Guess what color it is.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.159
Blue.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.560
Take a look.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.440
Black?

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.600
Take a look.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.620
I can't tell like this.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.760
I don't have this one.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.640
This is called

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.480
"Five-Stars Big Eyes".

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.360
I don't have a helmet like this

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.020
but I really like this helmet.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.360
Who should you thank?

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.400
Thank you...

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.200
Thank you, Mu.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.930
Say it again.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.320
Thank you, Mu!

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.560
You're welcome.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.160
Here, try the milk skin I brought.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.640
Do you like dairy products?

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.640
I can enjoy them.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.040
This is the really delicious milk skin...

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.920
Are you cold?

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.580
That's been really popular in Shanghai
lately.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.800
Try it.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.960
Is it good?

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.720
It's quite sweet.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.280
Let me open your gift, Zhao.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.760
It's a

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.600
printer.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.720
And it's pink.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.720
So it works with any phone, right?

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.200
Any phone...

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.560
Just connect with Bluetooth.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.880
Great.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.960
Then we can take photos today

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.920
and print them out.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.320
Sure.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.120
1,218 photos.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.159
Okay.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.160
If you run out, just look for me.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.760
Thank you for your gift.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.760
I really like it.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.080
Who should you thank?

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.160
Thank you for Zhao for the gift.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.800
I love it.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.160
Dear Mu and Zhao,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.200
if you had been a little braver back then;

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.920
if you had never separated,

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.800
would the pages of your story
have changed?

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.880
We crafted

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.680
a Thailand trip centered on
the theme of “What If.”

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.000
When "what if" is no longer a hypothesis.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.600
This time,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.600
seize the pen that charts your new path

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.080
and return to where you first met.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.159
May you walk through the winds of Thailand

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:40.720
and transform imagined "what ifs"

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.159
into every step of your present moment.

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.520
Before the journey begins,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.560
to help you understand each other better,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.680
build more rapport,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.240
please complete the following test.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.640
We look forward to seeing you
connect on the same wavelength.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.400
Connect on the same wavelength!

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.130
Do you prefer independent travel
or group tours?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.800
Do you prefer juice or coffee?

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.760
Coffee.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.220
You're following me on purpose,
aren't you?

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.160
Do you prefer the sunrise or sunset?

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.120
Sunset.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.560
Getting up early.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.490
Staying up late.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.280
You like getting up early?

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.080
I like the idea of it,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.640
but I can't do it

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.240
so I still stay up late.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.720
But I like it.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.220
Do you prefer adventurous challenges
or aesthetic experiences?

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.640
Three, two, one.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.000
Aesthetic experiences.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.600
You're just...

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.520
Going along with whatever you say.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.280
Yeah.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.400
Do you prefer expressing your thoughts
or making people guess?

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.960
Three, two, one.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.360
Expressing my thoughts.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.400
Do you prefer to accommodate others
or stick to your own views?

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.120
Stick to my own views.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.840
You also like to stick to your views?

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.440
Because my view might be right.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.240
But you don't like to
accommodate others either.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.560
Then as travel companions...

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.480
No, listen to me.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.440
We'll definitely argue.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.880
Both sides' views

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.960
might actually be

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.520
the same.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:56.920
The same.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.520
Right?

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.400
Isn't that being on the same wavelength?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.000
Most people wouldn't think like you do.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.440
But what if, right?

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.840
That was just a warm-up.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.100
Next, we're levelling up the questions.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.200
Who said hello first when you first met?

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.640
He first gave me

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.200
a very kind look.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.520
Then I did this to you.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.720
You spoke first,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.080
but I greeted you first.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.720
You looked at me first.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.720
He had this look

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.360
like he knew me from somewhere

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.840
but also didn't know me at the same time.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.720
After all, I've seen your shows,

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.680
right?

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.640
So how did it feel when you first met Mu?

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.840
When I first met Mu,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.679
it felt like déjà vu.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.280
Because I've seen so many...

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.280
Tell the truth.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.039
You clearly said that

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.360
I'm prettier in person, didn't you?

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.280
She's prettier in person.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.539
Better than on camera.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.640
When I first met you,

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.000
I thought you seemed a bit ditzy.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.040
I seemed ditzy?

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.240
Ditzy how?

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.040
Because when we were all
reading the script together,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.760
and this person would speak,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.480
you'd look at them like this,

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.000
then that person would speak,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.840
and you'd look at them like that,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.480
then another person would speak,

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.520
and you'd look at them too.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.050
Isn't that just a reaction?

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.180
I had to see what they were saying.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.040
I can take care of others.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.320
I think for big things,
I take care of you,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.880
and for small things, you take care of me.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.540
What big things have we faced?

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.080
For example,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.160
if there's a conflict,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.720
I'm always the one who makes peace.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.440
I just don't say anything.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.520
That's not making peace.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.160
But that's not bad either.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.400
Once you say let's make up, we make up.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.320
I'm the one who takes the first step.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.200
What about me?

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.360
You sulk.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.040
Didn't I already say that?

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.880
I don't sulk.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.600
I'm the one who...

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.760
Waits to take the first step, alright?

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.960
Waiting for Mike to take the first step.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.960
Do you recall any instances

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.040
where you took care of someone?

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.640
Where I took care of someone.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.120
There are many little things.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.600
Like when I'm dieting,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.640
he would share his

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.120
diet steak with me

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.240
and give me a couple bites

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.640
when I was really hungry.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.440
I really hate being hot.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.720
So she would take
those little cooling patches

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.160
and stick them here and here

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.040
like she's doing

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.920
acupuncture,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.080
all around my neck,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.480
and then point a fan at me.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.920
I'm probably not someone

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.320
who's really good
at taking care of others.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.320
But I think within

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.680
my line of sight,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.560
if I feel that

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.320
you need care,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:05.840
I will

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.300
generally look after you.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.640
That's true.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.760
For your upcoming trip,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.800
who do you think
will take care of whom more?

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.560
Who will take care of whom more?

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.680
I think we'll take care of each other.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.720
I might do a bit more.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.800
I'm a guy after all.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.460
I should take care of the girl.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.480
No, when I travel...

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.160
Oh, what?

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.120
I have more travel experience.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.880
This isn't a survival show.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.280
Well then,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.600
I'll just wait to be taken care of.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.240
You take care of me.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.770
Feel it, feel the "what if".

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.320
Who takes better photos?

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480
Do you even need to ask

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.280
this kind of question?

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.080
This is definitely

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.240
something I have authority to speak on.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.400
About taking photos.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.440
Back then,

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.970
many of the photos
were actually taken by Xin.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.280
Some muscle photos weren't taken by me.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.200
I took those muscle flexing photos myself.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.080
Can Mu improvise right now

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.400
and take 3 photos for Zhao?

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:56.960
Right now?

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.840
Of course.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.840
When it comes to taking photos,
I'm never tired.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.900
I haven't taken photos in a long time.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.280
Look at me.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.370
Boyfriend's perspective.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.880
We're waiting for our food now.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.560
Let's clink glasses.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.880
You can look ahead.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.720
Put that hand down.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.080
Put that hand down.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.080
Yes.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.280
I'll hold this.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.080
Yeah.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.480
That's it.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.360
Done!

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.490
The photos are done.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.220
Let's look at the results.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.900
Does he look handsome?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.060
It's really vibey.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.810
All about the vibes.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.320
Done!

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.680
Thanks.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.320
Who is better at providing
emotional support?

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920
It depends.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.920
Are we talking about happy times

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.480
or sad times?

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.640
I feel that

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.360
you're the kind of person

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.920
who is able to answer most questions.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.920
For example, what are you doing now?

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.160
I don't know.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.840
At least she'll say that she doesn't know.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.960
She actually responds.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.600
Everything gets a response.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.320
Why are you fidgeting with your hands?

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.480
I'm nervous.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.360
See? She always...

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.490
She always answers.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.920
Share a moment when the other person

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.520
made you feel emotionally supported.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.800
She tells these jokes

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.840
that others might not find that funny,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.570
but I think they're hilarious.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.360
When setting camera positions,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.040
my position might be slightly off,

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.240
then...

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:44.960
You do this.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.040
What's so funny about that? It's...

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.680
She could just say

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.360
move back a little,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.680
but instead she uses a whole set of

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.680
bizarre,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.160
complicated body language.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.600
There are many things
I don't even understand about myself,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.440
but he understands them.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.160
And when he expresses it,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.560
I somehow feel...

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.680
Like you resonate.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.080
Few guys can understand
what makes me tick.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.260
Who's better at being cutesy?

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.080
Do you even need to ask?

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.240
Three, two, one.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.560
If on the trip there's something
that Mu wants to try

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.360
but Zhao doesn't want to do it,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.490
how would you act cute to persuade him?

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.640
Want to go ride a motorcycle?

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.440
You're already starting to act it out,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.520
right?

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.280
No, I'm not going.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.440
So how would you act cute?

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.000
I'd just say, come on.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.600
If you don't want to go, forget it,

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.860
I'll just go by myself.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.360
I'm actually just okay.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.040
I'm not really...

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.360
I'm not particularly good at acting cute.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.680
She'll make her own case,

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.400
like we'll have a great time there.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.040
It's not really acting cute.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.120
I feel like she'll recommend things.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.360
I'll talk up something as super fun,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.200
like we'll catch shrimp like this,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.560
and then

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.600
when we actually get there, we find that

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.120
it's just okay.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.880
Just okay.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.800
When have my plans ever been just okay?

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.560
That time we went

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.080
out to sea.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:58.800
Out to sea.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.330
She planned it really well.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.280
We all got on the boat,
ready for a great time.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.280
Then she was just sitting there,

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.440
seasick or something?

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.120
I fell asleep.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:07.980
I was too tired.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.000
By the afternoon,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.930
the sea breeze was getting colder,

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.920
and we played in the water.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.850
Overall, it was pretty miserable.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.560
Really?

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:19.800
Really?

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.800
Not that it felt miserable, of course.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.600
I mean the scene probably looked...

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.720
It was gloomy with no sun

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.920
and there was nothing.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.320
So some of her plans

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.400
don't necessarily work out.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.080
That's true.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.960
But when she's planning,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.890
she's extremely

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.800
enthusiastic and professional.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.330
Her attitude is excellent.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.840
The next step of understanding

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.440
is achieving cognitive resonance.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.760
Next, one person will describe

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.080
and the other will answer.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.160
We hope that in your cooperation

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.890
you'll show better chemistry.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.880
This action.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.480
Blinking.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.320
Three words.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.650
Making eyes at someone.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.920
Excellent!

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.680
Six words.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.800
Something people like to eat in summer.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.560
Ice cream.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.000
Yes, and there's
a square-shaped thing in front...

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.360
What kind of abs do you have?

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:03.880
What flavor?

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:04.560
Chocolate ice cream.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.240
Correct!

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.920
That's a great description.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.960
Do you still have them now?

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.820
Yes, I still do.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.360
Something I love to say

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.320
to ask if something is true.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.280
An internet slang.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.240
Four words.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.800
Cute version.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:21.880
Four words?

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.840
For real?

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.480
Yes!

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.800
That really

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.520
came to mind instantly.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.520
Girls all like to buy...

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.080
Bags.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.540
And when a guy wants to say,

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.680
"Don't worry, I've got this,"

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.680
what does he...

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.560
what does he say?

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:39.720
One word.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.840
Covered.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.720
That's amazing!

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.160
Covered.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.720
That super viral song

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.880
recently—

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.610
the one everyone's dancing to—

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.520
“Grand Ambitions."

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.080
Right.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.680
Amazing!

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.640
Amazing!

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.170
That's a triple "amazing."

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.600
You two are the ultimate duo

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.840
and also the best travel partners.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.900
Congratulations
on unlocking the Thailand "If" Trip.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.800
Please plan your itinerary

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.680
based on Chapter One's theme—

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.920
"If We Meet Again."

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.400
Plan our itinerary...

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.160
I think

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.080
once we get to the airport,

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.720
we should start filming the vlog.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.160
Yeah, we should start shooting
from the moment we leave.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.200
Film the vlog, and then—

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.560
on the plane,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.600
and after we exit the terminal,
help me get some good shots, too.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.320
Okay.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.320
I'll get good shots for you, too.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.200
Then we'll go...

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.960
Is there anyone's coming to pick us up,

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.920
with

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.880
the flower garland?

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.120
Then we get in the car.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.600
We can contact Mike (Wu Yige)

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.680
to pick us up.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.560
He's a local.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.120
Call him now.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.480
Sure.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.320
Hello.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.250
We're about to arrive in Thailand.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.080
Mike, can you come pick us up?

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.560
What?

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.000
We'll be in Thailand soon.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.400
We're leaving any minute.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.000
We're already in the airport lounge.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.560
We're coming to Thailand soon.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.160
See you in four hours.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.280
Is it today?

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.240
Yes, today.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.440
Can't you see we're all...

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.520
Look, we're all packed and ready to go.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.980
We're already recording.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.119
Is it really today or...

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.880
Are you joking?

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.359
No joke.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.440
Why else would we be like this?

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.800
Alright, just kidding.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.400
It's tomorrow.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.079
The day after tomorrow.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:19.920
The day after tomorrow.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.079
The day after tomorrow.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.520
We're leaving the day after tomorrow.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.240
The day after tomorrow.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:22.680
We're leaving the day after tomorrow.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.319
What a chat.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.180
Where are you planning to take us?

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:29.320
My restaurant.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.480
What kind of food?

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.840
My restaurant isn't open yet.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.800
But you...

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.440
you...

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.400
just come first.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.720
Your Chinese is so good.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.080
Really? No way.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.800
My Chinese has gotten worse.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.240
No one here

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.520
speaks Chinese with me.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.450
In these five days,
we will make you improve rapidly.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.280
Okay.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.680
Mike(Wu Yige), bring us

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.680
the flowers.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.240
Flowers.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.920
Melon.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.400
Flowers?

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.200
The welcome flower garland.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.480
The "welcome to Thailand" one, right?

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:04.680
Yes.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.200
Yes.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.440
Okay.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.440
See you the day after tomorrow, bro.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.040
Okay.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.120
Bye-bye.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.040
Bye-bye.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.570
Please check your hitcard in front of you.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.480
Have fun on your "If" Trip to Thailand.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.400
Hitcard?

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.840
Please do not read the contents out loud.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.640
Don't read it. Just show me.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.240
Don't read it. Just show me.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.880
I won't.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.080
No need to read it out.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.280
I'll just take a look.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.320
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.000
What is written on your card?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.400
What is written on yours?

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.560
Okay, I get it.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.640
Please capture five moments

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.440
where you beat him up on the trip.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.440
Please capture your expression
when she beats you up.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.240
"THAI SWEET!"

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.640
Let's head out together!

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.120
Let's go to Hao Xiang Lai.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.760
Right here.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.640
A snack paradise right outside my place.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.920
Good food. Fun stuff.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.720
Everything.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.880
And super cheap.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.760
I have one near my place, too.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.480
Let's pick some tasty snacks.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.920
I like chicken feet.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.360
Let's get two small buns.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.120
Okay.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.120
This place has such a complete selection
of snacks.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.050
They have everything I love to eat.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.760
Take a few more.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.320
Let's go, Zhao.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.200
Let's go pay.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:34.640
Okay.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.240
I wonder how much this basket will cost.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.240
This huge bag of snacks
only cost a little over 100 yuan?

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.440
Hao Xiang Lai is truly tasty,
fun, and cheap.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.680
Xin, enjoy your snacks.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.560
Thank you.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.420
Come on, Zhao, help me take these.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.560
Wait, Zhao.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.160
What's that?

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.480
So cute.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.960
This Kaka princess bunny,

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.800
the good little kitty,

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.880
and the tour-guide bear.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.320
I like them all.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.440
Which one should I choose?

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.560
Don't hesitate.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.240
Take them all.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.040
They're not expensive anyway.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.640
Buying them all increases your chances.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.280
Then I'll take a whole box.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.720
I'll bring them to Thailand

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.240
to share with the locals.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.480
Let's go pay.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.180
Hello everyone, I'm Zhao.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.920
We're getting ready to leave for Thailand.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.840
Let me show you

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.170
what I've packed today.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.480
Two sun-protection shirts,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.320
the functional kind.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.280
They can be inflated

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.120
and turned into neck pillows.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.400
This is a sun umbrella.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.080
I also brought two CCD cameras

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.140
for taking photos.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.640
And mosquito repellent,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.560
because

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.820
Thailand might have a lot of mosquitoes.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.400
Okay, I'll go

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.080
pick up Mu,

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.810
and then we'll leave together.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.240
Time to go.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.160
Mu should be ready by now.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.850
She probably got up earlier than I did.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.520
Let me ask if she's up.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:13.960
She's

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.820
definitely up.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.880
I'm coming to pick you up now,

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.810
then we're heading to the airport.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.880
How are you doing?

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.480
Mu is ready to go.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.440
I heard someone's downstairs
to pick me up.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.240
Go.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:31.840
Go, go, go.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.120
Pretty Mu's OOTD.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.320
I'm almost there.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.480
Come out quickly.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.100
Coming.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.520
Looks like she's really dressed up.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.200
Where are you going?

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:08.720
Hello.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.560
Good morning.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.890
Let me take that for you.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.640
Thank you, Zhao.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.120
Are you going to Thailand with me?

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.680
That's...

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.000
that's

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.320
how Zhao talks today?

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.000
Let's go.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.250
Look, I'm wearing this on my wrist.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.410
Give it a detailed shot.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.240
Because my neck is too thick.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.480
If I wear it there,

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.210
it chokes me.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.040
Look, this is

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.440
the moon.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:56.970
The moon.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.520
Because it's from Pretty Mu.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.080
Pretty Mu.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.210
Pretty Mu necklace.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:01.760
Pretty Mu necklace.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.090
Mu represents the moon.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.400
I gave this to him five months early

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.680
as his birthday gift.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.240
Then on his actual birthday,

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:12.840
I forgot.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.560
Which activity
are you most looking forward to

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:19.960
on this trip?

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.400
I'm excited about the whole trip,

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.000
because I don't really know

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.660
what activities are planned.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.040
Didn't I show you?

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040
Didn't I show you?

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.160
I can't remember.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.400
That sounds a bit formal.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.320
Shrimp fishing.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.250
Shrimp fishing.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.200
Shrimp fishing is
what I'm excited about.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.160
Because you're way too excited

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.160
about the shrimp-fishing part,

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.620
I want to see how you'll do.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.960
That's something I did as a kid.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.720
She's always excited for this part,

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.880
but when it comes,

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.160
she might not have the energy

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.840
and ends up missing it.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.720
No way.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.360
I'll definitely do the shrimp fishing.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.800
My only concern is that

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.520
when I was little,

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.360
catching shrimp

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.880
was actually pretty hard.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.920
I'm afraid

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.600
now my skills are too advanced,

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.280
I'll catch them too easily,

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.920
and it won't be as fun.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.120
Welcome to Thailand.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.400
No matter how sweet Thai coconuts are,

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.000
they're still not sweeter than
the way you two look at each other.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.520
I'll take you to try

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.720
a very special restaurant in Thailand.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.120
Dinosaur egg.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.000
Black sand.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.520
This is fish.
