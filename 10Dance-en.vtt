00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:43.543
{\an8}A dancer once said

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.506
{\an8}that love sometimes takes
an unexpected shape

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.968
{\an8}and suddenly appears before you.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.519
{\an8}Hidden longings.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:05.732
{\an8}Passion without words.

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.987
{\an8}Graceful and serene.

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:14.741
{\an8}At times, fierce and wild.

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:20.038
{\an8}With a subtle game of give and take.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:40.809
To whom do we whisper our love?

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:45.687
How do we feel when our hands are joined?

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:47.065
Okay!

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:06.251
Maybe dance itself
is the vessel we need.

00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.213
A perfect way to nurture our love.

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:15.969
The steps are perfect.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.513
The form, flawless.

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:24.727
But this man's dance…
is missing something crucial.

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:31.401
A year ago,

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:34.653
I found out what it was.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.579
The 31st
All Japan Dance Championships,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.748
Latin American division champions,

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:50.712
Shinya Suzuki and Aki Tajima.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:59.636
And now, the ballroom division champions,

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:03.474
Shinya Sugiki and Fusako Yagami.

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.686
Sugiki-sensei!

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.314
Please give
a big round of applause

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:12.774
to our "Emperor of Dance," who won…

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:14.651
I hate this guy.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.990
Just seeing him pisses me off
for no reason.

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.207
And now,
our two magnificent champion pairs

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.543
will perform an honor dance.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.212
Champions, please.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.215
Bravo, bravo!

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:45.016
In competitive dance,
there are two different styles.

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:50.063
Ballroom dance,
which Shinya Sugiki specializes in.

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:56.944
The waltz, tango, Viennese waltz,
slow foxtrot, and quickstep.

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:58.862
They compete in all five dances.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:41.406
I specialize in the other styles,
Latin American.

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:47.078
Cha-cha-cha, samba,
rumba, paso doble, and jive.

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.914
We compete in all five.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:06.139
♪ Something broke in me that day ♪

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.558
♪ So away ♪

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.812
♪ Get back at you ♪

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:19.861
♪ Stood here dying on my feet ♪

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.281
♪ Feeling cold ♪

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.659
♪ Feeling weak ♪

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:31.204

♪ I only meet you in the moonlight ♪

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.293
♪ I know the Devil's inside… ♪

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:40.673
The dancers of these two styles
never compete against each other,

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.258
with one exception.

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:01.234
10 Dance.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.332
{\an8}The World Cup of Dance
is where dancers

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:19.754
{\an8}who have mastered both ballroom and Latin
compete in all ten dances.

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:26.426
{\an8}You need to have the stamina
to dance 40 songs in one day,

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:29.138
{\an8}with completely different
rhythms and steps.

00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:34.394
{\an8}Mentally, you've gotta stay focused
for hours.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:38.648
{\an8}Both your body and mind
are pushed to the limit.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:43.069
{\an8}It may look glamorous,
but it's basically a triathlon.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.239
{\an8}That's the exception.

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:48.491
10 Dance.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.635
- Top form!
- Bravo!

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:10.554
You were incredible.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.889
It's been a while since
you competed in Japan.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.142
Does it feel good to perform
for a home audience?

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:17.436
Yes, it's very good
to be back home.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:21.022
And Shinya Sugiki and Fusako Yagami wanted
to show a new side of ourselves.

00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:24.402
He wins as soon as he comes back.
I knew he would.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.530
Shinya Suzuki hardly compares.

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:32.492
- Thank you.
- Shinya Suzuki and Shinya Sugiki.

00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:33.577
Congratulations.

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.662
Only a two-letter difference
in their names,

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:38.166
but Latin and ballroom
are totally different styles.

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.418
And they're in

00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:43.336
completely different classes.

00:07:43.337 --> 00:07:44.881
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.273
Hello?

00:08:14.118 --> 00:08:15.327
What?

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:18.580
What do you mean
Shinya Sugiki invited us to the 10 Dance?

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:19.539
When?

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.459
- Just now.
- What?

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:23.044
I said no.

00:08:23.794 --> 00:08:25.086
You said no?

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:28.632
Wait, but it means that Shinya Sugiki
is offering to teach us himself, right?

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.217
- You care?
- Huh?

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.427
What's the big deal?

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.181
- Doesn't matter.
- What do you mean it doesn't matter?

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.683
Do you know what
the 10 Dance takes?

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:40.269
Know how many dances you do in a day?

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:44.481
Five ballroom, five Latin,
and you've gotta dance 'em four times.

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:47.025
First round, second round,
semis, and finals.

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.569
That's 40 songs.

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:52.323
We usually only dance 20 songs at most.

00:08:52.823 --> 00:08:54.867
That's double what we do. Double.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.702
But, you know,
even if it's just practice,

00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:59.913
I'd love to be led by Shinya Sugiki
at least once.

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.289
I don't care.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.751
I mean, I'm always playing the role
of a slut who gets dumped by a man,

00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:06.503
or a cheating woman,
or something like that.

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:09.507
Oh, really? You're the one who said
you can't pull off a princess.

00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:11.341
No, I didn't.

00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:14.344
Whatever. We're the national champions,
and they're the world champions.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:15.513
- Second.
- That's it.

00:09:19.016 --> 00:09:21.727
We took second in the World Championships.

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:27.858
I've never been first
at the World Championships.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.368
I know why you're always
second place in the world.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.954
Asians can't be number one--

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:43.749
I wonder when they'll finally see you
for who you are.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.128
A champion
who could compete at the Worlds,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.339
and yet gives it up time and again.

00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:54.426
I'm just a little fish
who likes being number one.

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:55.343
I'm good.

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:58.097
A little fish
who's king of his little pond.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.770
I guess I was wrong about you.

00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:10.318
You have the perfect style and physique,
but that's all.

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:20.620
What is it?

00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:25.249
- You wanna fight?
- I thought you had a fighting spirit.

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:32.131
But I see you're not even a rival.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:37.595
You running away?

00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:53.110
All right, I'll do it.

00:11:03.954 --> 00:11:05.831
You're not gonna break on me, are ya?

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.085
Sure you can handle it?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.926
Don't ditch when I get serious.

00:11:24.558 --> 00:11:25.976
Do your worst.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.398
I'll lead you all the way to the final.

00:11:30.898 --> 00:11:32.190
Latino.

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:50.918
What did he say? Huh?

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.754
Hey, Shinya!

00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:13.607
He's right.

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.486
I've got Latin blood coursing
through my veins.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.789
Somewhere deep down,
it drives me.

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:35.963
It feeds my dancing, my burning passion…

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:14.376
Hey, wake up.

00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:16.961
I said wake up!

00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:27.389
Good morning.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.726
- Put some clothes on.
- It's too early.

00:13:31.727 --> 00:13:34.813
Wanna catch a cold?
Here, which one's yours? This?

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:38.316
- Thank you.
- Morning. Here, put some clothes on.

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:40.027
- Mm, thanks.
- Come on, let's go!

00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:41.862
Jeez.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.781
What a mess.

00:13:47.284 --> 00:13:49.537
Put on some fucking clothes!

00:13:50.746 --> 00:13:52.957
All right! Let's go!

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:55.542
Hurry!

00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:05.219
Hey, buddy.

00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:30.911
What the hell is going on with you?

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:33.956
Are you gonna do it or not?

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:38.794
You are going to do it, right?

00:14:41.338 --> 00:14:43.632
And sure, you'd be taking a chance,

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:49.054
but they say the true champion
is the one who can win the 10 Dance.

00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:56.145
If you teach them the Latin dances

00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:59.607
and Sugiki teaches us ballroom in return…

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:04.652
then I think we can compete at the Worlds.

00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:05.738
It's not that.

00:15:06.488 --> 00:15:08.406
It's not about the Worlds
or any of that crap.

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:10.868
Hmm?

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:16.999
It's those eyes of his, staring at me.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:22.630
Drives me nuts!

00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:27.175
You don't have to shout like that.

00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:40.564
Come on! Hurry up!

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:43.400
Faster!

00:15:44.693 --> 00:15:46.153
I said hurry up!

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.616
- You know where it is?
- Yeah.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:54.118
You know,
I bet Fusako Yagami is a total bitch.

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:56.788
She seems really scary, almost dangerous.

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.873
- Dangerous, huh?
- I'm scared!

00:15:58.874 --> 00:16:00.793
Come on.

00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:11.719
Wow.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.056
This is amazing.

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:40.708
Good evening.

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:48.256
You're more than 30 minutes late.

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:50.551
Get your partner into a skirt. Hurry.

00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:54.722
We're sorry.

00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:58.058
- I'll show you the dressing room.
- Oh.

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:07.150
Come in.

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:09.235
Whoa, it's huge.

00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:10.862
Use anything you like.

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:12.031
Ah, thanks.

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:13.866
Wow.

00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:19.246
Okay.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:22.541
- I can take your coat.
- Oh, that would be great.

00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:27.046
Thanks.

00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:35.179
So think they'll be able to get along?

00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:38.766
I wouldn't worry.

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:42.936
"I really need Mr. Suzuki for Latin."

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.773
He kept whining and going on about that.

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:50.026
You're saying he whines all the time too?

00:17:54.823 --> 00:17:56.825
Why don't we check your hold
while we're waiting?

00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:02.414
Okay.

00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:06.752
How familiar are you
with ballroom dancing?

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:10.172
- I am a professional.
- I see.

00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:14.510
Then you'll take the lead,
and I'll follow.

00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:34.696
Lower your sense of contact.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.990
From the stomach down to the knees.

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:40.993
One, two, three.

00:18:40.994 --> 00:18:43.705
One, two, natural turn.

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:49.544
The waltz was originally
a courtship dance,

00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:52.797
but the hold is like wearing handcuffs.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:56.425
Graceful on the surface,
but with restraint and control.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.477
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:13.401
What is it? Something wrong?

00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:14.695
He rubbed his dick on me.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.948
I'm so sorry about this.

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:19.950
It's fine.

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.869
Shall we get started, then?

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:23.787
Yes.

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.957
- In ballroom, you're D Class?
- Yes.

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.083
Take my contact.

00:19:29.084 --> 00:19:31.252
- Let it sink into your body.
- Okay.

00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:32.504
What do you wanna do?

00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:35.464
Do we stop or continue?

00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:38.260
One, two, three. One, two, three.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.178
You can quit if you want.

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:42.180
Running spin turn.

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:46.642
One, two, three.

00:19:46.643 --> 00:19:48.352
One… Good.

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:53.024
One, two, and three.

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.026
One, two, spin, turn.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:57.320
One, two, three.

00:19:57.321 --> 00:19:58.864
One, whisk.

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:04.243
One, two, three.

00:20:06.496 --> 00:20:09.498
- Stretch your arm out, like this.
- Two, three, four.

00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:11.667
Your shoulder blades
move with your pelvis.

00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:15.589
Hockey stick. Two, three, four.

00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:19.343
Two, three, New York.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:22.596
- Catch it inside.
- Two, three, four.

00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:25.598
- Shoulder turn.
- Two, and three, and four.

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:26.724
Both arms?

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:29.685
- Two, three, four.
- Yes, like an undulation.

00:20:29.686 --> 00:20:32.189
Two, and three, and four.

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:35.233
Two, three, four.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:38.445
- Pelvis moves too.
- Two, and three, and four.

00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:40.738
Okay, that's enough.

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:41.740
How was it?

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:46.994
- Terrible.
- The same for the left.

00:20:46.995 --> 00:20:49.039
Your hip movement is so fake.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:50.999
Look.

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:54.169
Watch how my body moves.

00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:06.306
Four.

00:21:07.724 --> 00:21:10.686
Two, and three, and four.

00:21:12.479 --> 00:21:13.563
See that?

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:17.109
It's not just in the hips.

00:21:19.736 --> 00:21:21.863
When you do it,
your body's not undulating.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.075
Three and four.

00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:27.661
Feel the weight moving.

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:30.080
You've gotta feel it

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:31.915
from the spine

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:34.835
through the shoulder blades…

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:40.590
into the arm movements.

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:44.344
Two, three, four.

00:21:45.345 --> 00:21:48.056
Two, three, four.

00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:51.643
Two, and three, and four.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.649
See this? It's sweat.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.026
- Yes.
- Do you get it?

00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:01.485
Yes, I understand.

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.863
Your hip movement is amazing.

00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:05.573
It's my job to shake my hips.

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.326
- Think you can do it?
- Got it?

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:10.202
- Just copy what I do.
- Right.

00:22:10.203 --> 00:22:11.954
Come here. Put your hands right here.

00:22:11.955 --> 00:22:13.622
- Shorten it.
- On your hips.

00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:15.584
- Make it smaller.
- A little smaller?

00:22:16.251 --> 00:22:17.252
That's right.

00:22:18.545 --> 00:22:20.671
A bit more. Yeah, like that.

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:23.007
Two, and three, and four.

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:26.135
- Now squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
- Two, three, four.

00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:27.346
- Move less.
- That's it.

00:22:27.846 --> 00:22:30.431
Two, three, and four.

00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:31.599
Mm-hmm.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.144
- Two, three, four.
- That's it. That's it.

00:22:35.145 --> 00:22:38.357
Two, three, four.

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:42.361
- Two, three, four.
- Two, three, four.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.198
Two, and three, and four.
Aki, keep counting.

00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:49.409
- Two, three, four.
- Three, four.

00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:52.954
Two, three, four.

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:55.373
Two, three, four.

00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:57.500
If the waltz is an elegant courtship…

00:22:57.501 --> 00:22:59.668
Two, three, four.

00:22:59.669 --> 00:23:01.587
…then Latin dance is raw eroticism.

00:23:01.588 --> 00:23:03.172
…three, four.

00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:08.344
Arouse them, seduce them.

00:23:08.345 --> 00:23:10.388
Don't stop till you make 'em wet.

00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:12.473
Two, three, four.

00:23:12.474 --> 00:23:13.808
You're not sexy, guy.

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:16.311
- Two, three, four.
- Four.

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:19.772
Two, and three, and four.

00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:22.358
One, two, three.

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:26.987
One, two, three.

00:23:26.988 --> 00:23:30.741
Sorry. Suzuki can be
a little rough around the edges.

00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:31.827
Don't worry.

00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:34.121
So you two together?

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:39.709
Well, there was something there
at one point, I guess.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.338
But now, I just want to go further
as dance partners.

00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:48.760
How about you and Mr. Sugiki?

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:50.846
There's love in your dancing.

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:56.475
Mr. Sugiki took me as a partner
when I was nothing.

00:23:56.476 --> 00:23:58.228
He's brought me so far.

00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:01.940
I trust him with everything

00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:04.526
and just follow his lead.

00:24:06.778 --> 00:24:09.698
I've never felt loved by him at all,

00:24:10.657 --> 00:24:12.576
and I don't think I need to.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:31.636
We still have some time
before the first train.

00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:33.972
You can rest a little longer.

00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:40.061
Do you do this every day?

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.988
I can't stand it.

00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:53.992
I won't be second again.

00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:04.669
I'm not the type to try to make
an audience boo judges' decisions.

00:25:09.966 --> 00:25:11.259
I recall

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.262
you said you liked being number one,
didn't you?

00:25:16.097 --> 00:25:18.892
I also like being at the top of the pack.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.731
- I'm only at the top of my turf, right?
- Are you going to go all in?

00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:28.193
Doesn't it look like it?

00:25:36.284 --> 00:25:38.286
You be the judge of that.

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:33.550
God, it felt like the wind
had gone right through me.

00:26:35.552 --> 00:26:37.095
It stirred my soul.

00:26:37.637 --> 00:26:38.888
It felt like

00:26:39.931 --> 00:26:41.975
that hot wind of Havana.

00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.950
My soul is still in Havana.

00:27:00.994 --> 00:27:05.081
It's the kingdom of sun, music, and dance.

00:27:17.594 --> 00:27:20.721
Doesn't matter how small
the world may be,

00:27:20.722 --> 00:27:23.265
I sure as hell can't see Havana from here.

00:27:23.266 --> 00:27:24.225
…four.

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:27.895
- Two, three, four.
- Two, three, four.

00:27:27.896 --> 00:27:30.481
- Two, and three, and four.
- Two, three, four.

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:32.734
One, two, three.

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:35.194
One, two, three.

00:27:35.195 --> 00:27:37.780
- Face right.
- One, two, three.

00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:39.573
One, full count.

00:27:39.574 --> 00:27:44.828
One, two, three.

00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:45.830
One.

00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:48.416
Okay, one more time.

00:27:56.257 --> 00:27:57.633
Just a minute.

00:27:57.634 --> 00:28:00.678
- Can I put some music on?
- You're not ready.

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:03.305
- Let me put some music.
- I said no, you're not ready for it yet.

00:28:03.306 --> 00:28:05.766
This thing's not even working.

00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:08.185
My method is to drill the counts
into your body,

00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:10.771
without even the slightest distraction.

00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:13.190
- God, I want music.
- Okay, let's go.

00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:14.775
All right.

00:28:14.776 --> 00:28:16.402
Two, three.

00:28:16.403 --> 00:28:18.821
One, two, three.

00:28:18.822 --> 00:28:20.823
One, two, and three.

00:28:20.824 --> 00:28:25.703
One, two, three.

00:28:28.206 --> 00:28:29.207
What?

00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:32.751
Your lead is uncomfortable.

00:28:32.752 --> 00:28:34.378
- Your holds are self-centered…
- Hold on.

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:35.504
-…and unreliable.
- Hey.

00:28:35.505 --> 00:28:38.925
- Quit complaining. Move the way I steer.
- If I give in, I feel like I'm in danger.

00:28:47.308 --> 00:28:48.435
What is it?

00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:52.021
You're waltzing like you're a servant.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:01.698
What does that mean?

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:07.537
The waltz is danced
by ladies and gentlemen.

00:29:08.455 --> 00:29:11.750
It looks very elegant,
but it's also relentless.

00:29:13.793 --> 00:29:18.006
The woman must dance in those high heels,
twisting her waist for hours on end.

00:29:19.048 --> 00:29:22.385
The pain is pure torture.

00:29:26.473 --> 00:29:28.015
And in such a state,

00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:31.186
she will not yield
to a rough and vulgar man.

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:47.118
- What the hell?
- You should try being the woman for once.

00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:50.037
Lower your shoulder blades
and turn out your arms.

00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:51.872
That part is the same as the man's.

00:29:51.873 --> 00:29:55.209
Now, keep your hips there,
but rotate only your chest to the left.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.044
Your shoulders to the right.

00:29:57.045 --> 00:30:00.297
Stretch your neck.
Stretch it away from your right.

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:02.217
Up to the left. That's it.

00:30:04.719 --> 00:30:07.138
Now, get up on your toes.

00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:13.061
Higher.

00:30:14.854 --> 00:30:17.273
Hold it right there. Stay.

00:30:28.743 --> 00:30:30.578
Your stance is beautiful.

00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:37.877
Without me,
just standing is hard, isn't it?

00:30:41.714 --> 00:30:45.592
During hardship, the gentleman
offers his hand to support his partner.

00:30:45.593 --> 00:30:48.179
That's how it works in ballroom dance.

00:31:04.821 --> 00:31:06.865
"Move the way I steer you," right?

00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:18.251
Natural turn.

00:31:19.502 --> 00:31:22.588
Running spin turn.

00:31:22.589 --> 00:31:24.423
Chassé roll.

00:31:26.634 --> 00:31:28.303
Left whisk.

00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:33.558
Standing spin.

00:31:40.106 --> 00:31:44.151
Syncopated running finish.

00:31:54.495 --> 00:31:56.247
Throwaway.

00:31:57.248 --> 00:31:59.584
Oversway.

00:32:08.134 --> 00:32:09.302
How was that?

00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:11.888
Did you feel like a princess?

00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:50.551
Let's go get something to eat.

00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:03.231
Hmm?

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:05.650
What's that?

00:33:08.444 --> 00:33:10.529
- Thank you.
- This is coronation chicken.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:14.158
Served at Queen Elizabeth's coronation
in 1953.

00:33:19.372 --> 00:33:20.206
Mmm.

00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:22.708
The apricots you just tasted

00:33:22.709 --> 00:33:26.253
were arranged
to resemble scattered jewels.

00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:29.047
Britain was victorious,
but they were still rationing at the time,

00:33:29.048 --> 00:33:31.968
and this dish astonished guests
from around the world.

00:33:45.565 --> 00:33:48.191
Elbows off the table.
That's how a dog eats.

00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:50.278
I'm eating like this 'cause it's good.

00:33:51.404 --> 00:33:52.613
You get it, right?

00:33:53.406 --> 00:33:54.323
It's good.

00:33:54.824 --> 00:33:55.867
Tastes like curry.

00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:03.249
More wine. Mm.

00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:09.255
You shouldn't hold the glass
while it's being poured.

00:34:11.924 --> 00:34:14.217
When you're at a banquet,
you don't hold it by the bowl

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:16.053
but lower on the stem, like this.

00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:17.055
I got it.

00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:18.764
Hmm?

00:34:18.765 --> 00:34:22.018
What does any of this
have to do with ballroom dancing?

00:34:24.395 --> 00:34:25.813
I know how to eat, man.

00:34:36.324 --> 00:34:38.076
Imagine this scenario.

00:34:38.868 --> 00:34:43.956
You manage to beat every other 10 dancer
and rise to the top of the world.

00:34:46.292 --> 00:34:47.667
After your honor dance,

00:34:47.668 --> 00:34:51.047
you get an invitation
from someone who loved your performance.

00:34:51.631 --> 00:34:53.966
This is not a wrap party
at a dance school.

00:34:55.718 --> 00:34:58.804
Big-time sponsors and patrons
the envy of all dancers

00:34:58.805 --> 00:35:00.431
will be waiting for you.

00:35:04.018 --> 00:35:06.187
I get it now.

00:35:07.647 --> 00:35:09.816
So this is another lesson for me?

00:35:13.402 --> 00:35:14.779
Okay, guy.

00:35:20.868 --> 00:35:22.536
I have a lesson for you.

00:35:57.989 --> 00:36:00.031
So, you like it?

00:36:00.032 --> 00:36:01.241
Yes.

00:36:01.242 --> 00:36:03.119
It's the real taste of Cuba.

00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:11.502
Drink.

00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:13.796
Come on, drink!

00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:16.339
Break!

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.675
Take a break!

00:36:18.718 --> 00:36:20.136
He's boring!

00:36:24.056 --> 00:36:27.142
- Let's get him drinking!
- So you're the "Emperor," huh?

00:36:27.143 --> 00:36:29.269
It's fantastic!

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:31.104
- Salud!
- Salud!

00:36:31.105 --> 00:36:32.899
Salud!

00:36:33.774 --> 00:36:35.234
- Salud.
- Salud.

00:36:39.655 --> 00:36:41.156
Hey, Sugiki, let's go!

00:36:41.157 --> 00:36:42.366
- Huh?
- Come on!

00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:44.784
- Smile!
- What?

00:36:44.785 --> 00:36:46.411
Just smile, man!

00:36:46.412 --> 00:36:48.079
Fake it if you have to!

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.456
Just smile!

00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:52.083
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:36:58.466 --> 00:37:00.342
Don't think about it! Don't…

00:37:00.343 --> 00:37:02.428
Don't count with this. Make some noise!

00:37:03.012 --> 00:37:05.890
Latin is about
making your body the instrument.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.074
At around the same time
Queen Elizabeth II

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:25.993
was serving coronation chicken,

00:37:27.453 --> 00:37:30.456
Castro was starting his revolution
in Cuba.

00:37:33.626 --> 00:37:37.255
That's probably how big
the difference was between us as well.

00:37:41.509 --> 00:37:43.802
SUZUKI DANCE SCHOOL

00:37:43.803 --> 00:37:45.553
It's almost like a wave…

00:37:47.306 --> 00:37:49.100
…right through his fingertips.

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:52.895
While holding his hand, I can…

00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:55.273
I feel his emotions, you know?

00:37:56.232 --> 00:37:57.233
You get it?

00:38:00.194 --> 00:38:01.737
Like superiority.

00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:04.615
Possessiveness.

00:38:05.408 --> 00:38:07.034
The urge to control.

00:38:08.703 --> 00:38:11.205
And sometimes I can feel gentleness.

00:38:11.831 --> 00:38:13.124
Expectation.

00:38:15.459 --> 00:38:17.836
I don't even know how
to explain it properly.

00:38:17.837 --> 00:38:20.714
I mean, it's like
I can feel everything he's feeling.

00:38:20.715 --> 00:38:21.966
You know?

00:38:23.259 --> 00:38:25.260
You sound like you're in love.

00:38:25.261 --> 00:38:26.387
Huh?

00:38:28.055 --> 00:38:29.307
Don't be stupid.

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:41.694
- Look.
- Hmm?

00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:44.989
Sugiki.

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:48.826
Hey, what's up?

00:38:51.245 --> 00:38:52.288
Are you there?

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.584
You there? Can't hear you.

00:38:57.084 --> 00:39:00.754
This is
the UK's Best Dance Championships…

00:39:00.755 --> 00:39:01.671
The UK's Best?

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:04.175
…Professional Latin semifinal.

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:06.259
The paso doble.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.470
You're in the UK?

00:39:08.387 --> 00:39:10.972
Didn't I tell you?
That night we went out,

00:39:10.973 --> 00:39:13.517
I thought I mentioned
I was leaving the next day.

00:39:14.435 --> 00:39:16.228
- No, you didn't.
- All right.

00:39:17.104 --> 00:39:19.898
It's a competition I enter every year.
You must've known.

00:39:19.899 --> 00:39:21.274
That's not the point.

00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:25.403
I'm next. Gotta go.

00:39:25.404 --> 00:39:28.031
Wait, hold on. Hold on.

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:28.949
Yes?

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.453
Just come back soon.

00:39:57.436 --> 00:39:58.686
What did he say?

00:39:58.687 --> 00:40:01.981
This year's Open,
we're gonna move up two in the rankings.

00:40:01.982 --> 00:40:02.941
Huh?

00:40:02.942 --> 00:40:05.026
And keep the All-Japan Champion title.

00:40:06.612 --> 00:40:07.446
Then…

00:40:10.699 --> 00:40:11.909
in 10 Dance…

00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:15.579
we'll beat Sugiki.

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:18.081
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:21.876
we now come to
the Professional Ballroom semifinal.

00:40:21.877 --> 00:40:24.671
Twelve couples have been recalled.

00:40:24.672 --> 00:40:27.132
Please welcome them to the floor.

00:40:44.066 --> 00:40:46.777
All present and correct.

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:50.823
Your first dance, the slow waltz.

00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:08.215
There's Ms. Martha.

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:11.885
She's the president of the WDL,
isn't she?

00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:14.847
She's a mentor devoted
to fostering Asian dancers.

00:41:15.347 --> 00:41:16.806
Sugiki's her prize student.

00:41:16.807 --> 00:41:19.685
He's indispensable
in their Asian market strategy.

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:23.563
I thought they were extraordinary.
They seem to be flourishing,

00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:25.940
although I wonder…
perhaps a different combination.

00:41:30.905 --> 00:41:33.323
What is
with that ridiculously exaggerated hold

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:35.117
you seem to insist on doing?

00:41:35.951 --> 00:41:38.077
All you are doing
is placing a strain on Fusako.

00:41:38.078 --> 00:41:40.706
There is absolutely no unity
in your dancing.

00:41:44.418 --> 00:41:47.505
It's best to retire
at the height of your glory.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:51.341
Have you ever imagined
what it would be like

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:53.009
when the audience grows tired of you?

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.178
Martha.

00:41:55.888 --> 00:42:00.851
Alberto Boemer has been crowned
World Latin Champion 11 years in a row.

00:42:04.146 --> 00:42:06.439
I haven't even been champion once.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:10.569
Dance is neither
about technique nor stamina.

00:42:11.237 --> 00:42:14.323
Love is what makes it whole, but

00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:18.494
I don't feel any love
in the way you dance.

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:24.375
Hm.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.133
Watch your frame.
Make the adjustment.

00:42:34.134 --> 00:42:35.468
Yes, beautiful.

00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:36.428
That's it.

00:42:37.012 --> 00:42:38.555
Very nice.

00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:40.808
Stretch your arms even more.

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:44.269
Yes, very nice.

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:46.771
Yes, that's good.
Good work today.

00:42:46.772 --> 00:42:48.690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:42:48.691 --> 00:42:50.233
When did you get back?

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:52.569
- Thank you for coming.
- See you next time.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:53.487
Thank you.

00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:06.083
Let's try it with music today.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:24.851
Two, three. One, two, three.

00:43:24.852 --> 00:43:37.864
One, two, three.

00:43:37.865 --> 00:43:40.074
Careful. Two, three.

00:43:40.075 --> 00:43:42.286
One, full count.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:45.372
Two, three. One.

00:45:07.329 --> 00:45:09.831
- Can I ask you something?
- Hmm?

00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:12.084
Did you grow up
in Martha Milton's house?

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:15.879
Yes.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.508
My mother was
with me, too, at first.

00:45:21.927 --> 00:45:24.012
It felt like I had two mothers.

00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:28.350
One day,

00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:31.645
Martha took me to the Blackpool Tower.

00:45:33.063 --> 00:45:35.232
I saw a large framed photograph there.

00:45:38.944 --> 00:45:42.613
Martha and a man
who was as dour as the Grim Reaper.

00:45:42.614 --> 00:45:45.908
They looked like
they were ascending into the heavens.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.252
Do you want to dance like this?

00:45:56.962 --> 00:45:58.005
Then,

00:45:59.173 --> 00:46:00.382
Shinya,

00:46:02.217 --> 00:46:03.719
become a man.

00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:08.223
Become the kind of man admired by all.

00:46:10.142 --> 00:46:12.144
The finest gentleman.

00:46:19.568 --> 00:46:22.488
So you admired him
and wanted to be just like him?

00:46:23.989 --> 00:46:24.948
No.

00:46:26.408 --> 00:46:31.079
I think I wanted to take his place,
to be beautiful and terrifying.

00:46:33.582 --> 00:46:35.709
Until I was consumed by fear.

00:46:45.093 --> 00:46:47.471
Cuba, what's it really like?

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.890
- Cuba?
- Yes.

00:46:50.766 --> 00:46:52.434
It's music.

00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:54.102
Dance.

00:46:54.603 --> 00:46:55.437
Love.

00:46:57.773 --> 00:46:59.399
Romance and the sea.

00:47:02.694 --> 00:47:06.323
Cubans fall in love so easily.
Then they marry.

00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:08.992
My mom was like that.

00:47:09.785 --> 00:47:12.538
Every time we moved to a new place,
it happened.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.097
Is the sky blue?

00:47:35.269 --> 00:47:36.603
It's so blue.

00:47:37.813 --> 00:47:40.731
The beaches are always empty,
so when you fall in love,

00:47:40.732 --> 00:47:41.984
you go to the beach.

00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:45.737
No one disturbs you there.

00:47:47.072 --> 00:47:49.491
It's just the two of you
under the palm trees.

00:47:56.039 --> 00:47:57.082
Hm.

00:48:13.432 --> 00:48:15.559
♪ Kiss me ♪

00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:20.814
♪ Kiss me deeply ♪

Slow, slow.

00:49:49.361 --> 00:49:50.445
Quick, quick.

00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:52.072
Hold it there.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.906
Breathe in.

00:49:53.907 --> 00:49:55.616
- Right here.
- Okay.

00:49:55.617 --> 00:49:56.784
Like that.

00:49:56.785 --> 00:49:57.703
Quick.

00:49:58.787 --> 00:49:59.788
That's it.

00:50:00.372 --> 00:50:02.666
I just need a drink of water. Sorry.

00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:05.002
That's it.

00:50:06.628 --> 00:50:07.879
Very good.

00:50:09.381 --> 00:50:10.632
A little more open.

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:13.510
That's it.

00:50:14.386 --> 00:50:15.302
Very good.

00:50:15.303 --> 00:50:19.640
You know, Shinya's been crazy
about Mr. Sugiki for a while too.

00:50:19.641 --> 00:50:20.642
Yeah?

00:50:21.643 --> 00:50:24.980
A few years ago,
he happened to see a video.

00:50:26.565 --> 00:50:28.942
He said, "He's the perfect dancer."

00:50:30.152 --> 00:50:33.237
But then he said, "It looks
like he's in pain," which is weird.

00:50:33.238 --> 00:50:35.281
Keep going like that. Okay.

00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:36.450
Quick, quick.

00:50:37.617 --> 00:50:39.453
Use your leg for support.

00:50:39.953 --> 00:50:43.582
I think you wore a black dress?
You were dancing the tango, right?

00:50:45.751 --> 00:50:49.171
I don't think that was me.

00:50:50.255 --> 00:50:51.381
- Quick, quick.
- Huh?

00:50:52.007 --> 00:50:55.468
I've never worn
a black dress in a competition.

00:50:55.469 --> 00:50:56.845
And again.

00:50:58.472 --> 00:50:59.890
Shall we continue?

00:51:00.515 --> 00:51:01.391
Hm.

00:51:03.018 --> 00:51:04.393
Support it.

00:51:04.394 --> 00:51:07.521
Wide, wide. Quick, quick.

00:51:07.522 --> 00:51:09.441
Walk, walk.

00:51:10.942 --> 00:51:12.110
Position.

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:15.489
Neck.

00:51:16.156 --> 00:51:17.157
Quick.

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.660
Don't rush. Don't rush. Don't rush.

00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:30.087
Slow.

00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:33.839
Frame, frame. Keep your frame.

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.008
Don't break it.

00:51:40.222 --> 00:51:42.181
Rotation. Rotation.

00:51:42.182 --> 00:51:45.435
Together. Do it together.
Don't try to dance on your own!

00:51:54.694 --> 00:51:55.737
Take a break.

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:01.284
- Aki, why don't you get some water?
- Okay.

00:52:19.678 --> 00:52:21.429
What's different between our leads?

00:52:23.056 --> 00:52:25.475
Mm… well…

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:29.479
With Mr. Sugiki,

00:52:30.397 --> 00:52:32.732
I know exactly where I should be.

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:36.611
No matter what the movement is,
it never varies.

00:52:37.946 --> 00:52:42.950
And… the balance
between force and gentleness,

00:52:42.951 --> 00:52:45.245
it makes my body want to follow his lead.

00:52:46.413 --> 00:52:48.957
And, then, with you,

00:52:49.916 --> 00:52:52.918
it's more like,
"I'm having fun, so you must be, too."

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:03.013
Sometimes that works for me,
and sometimes it doesn't.

00:53:03.513 --> 00:53:04.389
Hmm?

00:53:07.475 --> 00:53:12.104
Fusako said that when she and Mr. Sugiki
entered their first competition,

00:53:12.105 --> 00:53:13.440
he said to her…

00:53:15.942 --> 00:53:17.277
"Ms. Yagami."

00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:20.279
- "Now that you're…"
- Now that you're my partner…

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:23.575
I will make you dance
more beautifully than anyone.

00:53:25.952 --> 00:53:27.954
Every dancer in the world will say,

00:53:28.455 --> 00:53:30.873
"Fusako Yagami is beautiful."

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:33.001
"I want to be Fusako Yagami."

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:38.590
That will be my ultimate joy.

00:53:49.976 --> 00:53:51.519
Jeez.

00:53:52.145 --> 00:53:54.521
I wish someone would say that to me.

00:53:54.522 --> 00:53:58.692
You know, have that kind of caring?

00:53:58.693 --> 00:54:00.319
- You don't have it.
- Caring?

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.695
- Caring.
- No way.

00:54:01.696 --> 00:54:04.532
- You should try it sometime.
- It's sentimental crap.

00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:11.580
Oh, hey. By the way…

00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:14.208
…that video you sent over to me
the other day?

00:54:14.209 --> 00:54:15.501
Yeah?

00:54:15.502 --> 00:54:17.337
That wasn't Fusako dancing.

00:54:20.465 --> 00:54:21.465
You sure?

00:54:21.466 --> 00:54:23.927
She told me
she never wore black while competing.

00:54:27.138 --> 00:54:28.974
Or something like that.

00:54:45.699 --> 00:54:48.576
Havana salad and a… beer?

00:55:02.173 --> 00:55:03.842
- Hey!
- Hey.

00:55:07.929 --> 00:55:09.389
I don't know what's going on.

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:12.434
I can't dance anymore.

00:55:16.354 --> 00:55:17.981
He's the one in control.

00:55:18.857 --> 00:55:21.985
I thought I was the one using him, but

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:25.071
I'm the one being used.

00:55:27.866 --> 00:55:31.036
Keeps throwing me off my game
and keeping me on edge.

00:55:32.537 --> 00:55:34.331
I mean, what am I to him?

00:55:37.584 --> 00:55:38.752
Sounds like love.

00:55:40.045 --> 00:55:43.048
What are you talking about?

00:55:45.925 --> 00:55:47.302
Do you want him?

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.017
Seriously, do you?

00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:57.394
Guys can be attracted
to other guys, right?

00:55:57.395 --> 00:55:59.731
Ah, come on!

00:56:01.441 --> 00:56:04.193
If you're cool
with someone else stealing him, back off.

00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:05.778

You gonna die if you don't dance?

00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:19.722
Will you?

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:05.851
Here.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:06.936
Thank you. Cheers.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.126
Can I ask you something?

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:32.795
Sure.

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:39.302
About three years ago,
when you were at the Worlds…

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:44.641
who was the woman
in the black dress you were dancing with?

01:00:48.102 --> 01:00:49.479
It wasn't Fusako.

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:52.649
She told Aki it wasn't.

01:00:56.694 --> 01:00:58.529
I'm sure she'd rather forget.

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:00.907
No.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.911
Maybe she really can't remember

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:06.788
what happened.

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:17.340
What you saw, Mr. Suzuki,
was the World Championships in England.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.261
We hadn't been dancing together
for very long.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:31.229
The audience really seemed to be fixated
on my new partner.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:08.015
That day,
the atmosphere was so tense.

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:12.310
It happened during
the last dance of the semifinals.

01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:14.438
- We were dancing the quickstep.

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:17.858
♪ Don't let me snooze
I was born to wear these shoes… ♪

01:02:19.652 --> 01:02:20.902
Are you okay?

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.282
Are you all right?

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:27.325
It's not unusual
for dancers to fall,

01:02:27.326 --> 01:02:30.830
but I'd never been associated
with such a bad fall before.

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:35.333
♪ Wake me up to dance, dance ♪

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:38.128
That was when it started.

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:44.385
She began to unravel.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:53.769
Years earlier, at a different competition,

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.146
she was dancing with another partner,

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:58.441
and a similar thing happened.

01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:02.069
She began to suffer
from post-traumatic stress.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.784
I knew she was going through that,

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:12.288
but I still got her in that dress
and made her compete in the final.

01:03:31.682 --> 01:03:33.851
How did I make her dance, you ask?

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:43.027
I yelled at and berated her relentlessly.

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:51.117
Even as her body froze,
her face still reacted to my words,

01:03:51.118 --> 01:03:54.080
and her feet did exactly as I commanded.

01:03:55.289 --> 01:03:57.374
Your frame, it's loose.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:00.253
Right side up.

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:04.172
Keep it. I said keep it.
Your frame is loose.

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:05.132
It's too loose!

01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:17.060
You're heavy!

01:04:19.313 --> 01:04:21.357
Lift your body up. Higher.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:22.775
Keep it.

01:04:24.068 --> 01:04:24.986
Keep it.

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:29.322
I kept pushing her
until the end of the competition.

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:37.248
And then,

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:40.418
to my shame,

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:45.006
I found myself liking her in that state.

01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:54.515
That's the kind of man I am, I suppose.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.269
Not a gentleman.

01:04:59.353 --> 01:05:01.147
More of a Grim Reaper.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.699
Why did I ask him about it?

01:05:18.497 --> 01:05:21.083
I have caused Ms. Yagami so much pain.

01:05:23.502 --> 01:05:25.588
Please keep this between us, okay?

01:05:33.554 --> 01:05:35.514
Was it a confession I wanted?

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:40.603
Did I wanna hear him reveal weakness?

01:05:58.204 --> 01:05:59.622
Lame, man.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.401
I'll stop if you want.

01:08:24.683 --> 01:08:27.603
Before I knew it,
my body was moving on its own.

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.193
All I could do was give in to it.

01:08:35.152 --> 01:08:37.279
Surrender to the gods of dance.

01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:40.009
Hang onto that persona of yours.

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:46.098
You can be the Grim Reaper.

01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:56.483
I'll be the angel who defeats
the Grim Reaper of Blackpool.

01:10:23.135 --> 01:10:24.428
When I beat you,

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:28.140
you'll finally be free
of all that suffering.

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.355
I really admire you, you know.

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:41.880
Let's go overseas together
next time.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.552
We'll enter as two pairs
in the World Championship at Blackpool.

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:53.058
I will unveil you to the world.

01:11:54.184 --> 01:11:55.811
It'll be your debut.

01:13:20.938 --> 01:13:22.105
How are you?

01:13:26.193 --> 01:13:29.112
That's Martha, the president of the WDL.

01:13:29.113 --> 01:13:32.198
And he's a former world champion
who won the Carl Alan Award.

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:34.909
That's the tournament director,
and that's a big-shot businessman

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:38.038
who got a medal
for his contributions to the dance world.

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:41.457
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:42.876
Hello, Nino.

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:46.254
Fabio, good to see you.

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.631
- Fusako.
- Hi.

01:13:48.632 --> 01:13:50.633
- Oh, hi, Catherine.
- Nice to see you.

01:13:50.634 --> 01:13:52.218
Let me introduce you.

01:13:52.219 --> 01:13:55.012
This is our choreographer, Nino,
and our designer, Fabio.

01:13:55.013 --> 01:13:57.850
And this is our hair
and makeup artist, Catherine.

01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:00.977
They're my European tour team.

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:02.395
Absolutely. Yes.

01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:03.312
Hi, guys.

01:14:03.313 --> 01:14:06.065
So you're the other Shinya?

01:14:06.066 --> 01:14:09.068
- Very nice to meet you. A real pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

01:14:09.069 --> 01:14:11.195
So cute.

01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:12.947
And that's Aki, I think.

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.031
Yes.

01:14:15.659 --> 01:14:17.452
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.662
- Very nice to meet you.
- Enjoy yourself.

01:14:19.663 --> 01:14:20.913
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

01:14:20.914 --> 01:14:22.707
- See you soon.
- Hi.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:24.375
Alberto!

01:14:24.376 --> 01:14:25.668
Alberto!

01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:27.253
So nice to see you!

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:29.465
That's Alberto, the Latin champion.

01:14:37.264 --> 01:14:38.599
Excuse me.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:40.684
Shinya.

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:47.691
He's the ballroom world champion.

01:14:48.358 --> 01:14:49.401
Giulio.

01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:52.862
It's been a while.

01:14:52.863 --> 01:14:54.865
Happy to see you made it.

01:14:56.366 --> 01:14:58.743
And that's Giulio's partner,

01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:01.413
the queen of the dance world, Liana.

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:06.418
She's also Mr. Sugiki's ex-girlfriend.

01:15:11.965 --> 01:15:13.759
I'm here to tell you something.

01:15:16.136 --> 01:15:17.553
Liana and I

01:15:17.554 --> 01:15:20.015
are getting married after the competition.

01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:25.687
Thank you for coming over here to tell me.

01:15:26.313 --> 01:15:27.898
I have your blessing?

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:29.942
Of course.

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.528
Congratulations.

01:15:35.447 --> 01:15:37.324
It's okay, Sugiki.

01:15:37.824 --> 01:15:40.118
I'll make sure you see no one but me.

01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:46.250
Mr. Moretti.

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:47.959
Nice to meet you.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.211
My name is Shinya Suzuki,

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:52.713
and I plan on taking
first place in ballroom

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:54.967
at the next world championship.

01:15:58.303 --> 01:16:00.138
I've been a fan for a long time.

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:03.225
Make sure you remember my face.

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:20.367
Sugiki, you coming?

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:21.910
Yes.

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:36.091
Yeah?

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:41.762
How are you feeling?

01:16:50.814 --> 01:16:52.608
Here's the schedule for tomorrow.

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:09.708
I want to try more than Latin.

01:17:11.043 --> 01:17:12.836
I wanted to give ballroom a shot.

01:17:14.838 --> 01:17:16.423
Look, we've been over this.

01:17:16.923 --> 01:17:21.094
Keep the fact that you also
do ballroom secret till 10 Dance.

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:22.638
Hmm?

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:27.851
You just wanna settle things
with Giulio, right?

01:17:35.025 --> 01:17:36.485
Just do as you're told, okay?

01:17:39.112 --> 01:17:40.989
You like pushing people around.

01:17:43.575 --> 01:17:44.660
Fusako.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:48.997
And me?

01:17:57.547 --> 01:17:59.633
Could be you're the fool in the scenario.

01:18:04.429 --> 01:18:06.515
That's why your girl was stolen from you.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:20.320
Just focus on the competition for now.

01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:25.117
Understood?

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:18.253
I've decided to stop dancing with you…

01:19:22.132 --> 01:19:25.010
and pair up with Giulio instead.

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:32.058
I need to choose the path
that will make me a champion.

01:19:33.518 --> 01:19:35.145
And if I stay with you,

01:19:36.062 --> 01:19:39.274
I will never become a world champion.

01:19:41.485 --> 01:19:42.736
I'm sure of it.

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.786
How could she be so sure

01:19:52.704 --> 01:19:54.623
that I could never win?

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:03.673
If it is true, why do I keep striving?

01:20:25.904 --> 01:20:30.867
Dance is neither
about technique nor stamina.

01:20:32.118 --> 01:20:35.247
Love is what makes it whole.

01:20:41.419 --> 01:20:43.254
Love won't make me win.

01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:12.617
Thank you.

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:15.661
- Go on in. Upstairs and to the right.
- Straight up the stairs.

01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:16.955
Enjoy yourselves.

01:21:17.622 --> 01:21:18.664
Thank you.

01:21:25.088 --> 01:21:27.464

The World Championships
are just that.

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:38.350
Over 200 of the world's top pairs
come to compete.

01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:42.731
One by one, they're eliminated,
like some blood sport.

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:45.025
Those who survive, the chosen few,

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:48.361
go at it tooth and nail
for the ultimate titles

01:21:48.945 --> 01:21:51.906
of ballroom and Latin world champions.

01:22:11.551 --> 01:22:12.843
You look beautiful.

01:22:12.844 --> 01:22:15.263
Thanks. You too.

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:29.026
You know, Mr. Sugiki
was seriously thinking of retiring

01:22:29.027 --> 01:22:30.487
not too long ago.

01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:35.241
After he and Liana broke up,

01:22:35.742 --> 01:22:38.328
he couldn't find a partner
who was at his level.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:43.166
The ones he did find couldn't keep up
with his strict training.

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:47.253
The only option he had

01:22:47.879 --> 01:22:50.048
was picking me, the dropout.

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:55.762
He thinks the only way
he can win the title

01:22:56.596 --> 01:22:59.140
is by pushing himself
to the breaking point.

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:07.399
I just want… to see
what we can accomplish together.

01:24:40.116 --> 01:24:44.453
Our next competition
is the Professional Latin final.

01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:47.791
Please welcome our finalists to the floor.

The finest dancers

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.610
tell stories with their bodies.

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:04.367
They can show the strength
and stoicism of an ancient tree,

01:26:04.868 --> 01:26:07.578
or they can show lightness and air

01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:11.582
as if wings had magically sprouted
from their ankles.

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:23.510
Wow, number 23. Who is that?

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:25.512
His name's
Shinya Suzuki, apparently.

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:28.599
- Shinya Suzuki?
- Have you ever heard of this guy?

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.601
No, never. Must be an amateur.

01:26:30.602 --> 01:26:32.478
- I guess.
- He's really good.

01:26:58.963 --> 01:27:04.010
The story his body was telling
was pure inspiration.

01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:10.642
Suddenly,

01:27:11.684 --> 01:27:14.062
I could see a way forward.

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:28.200

01:27:28.201 --> 01:27:29.910

Oh God, I didn't know
anyone could dance like that.

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:41.421
Who is that?
Is that the Japanese guy?

01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:42.422
Wow.

01:27:42.423 --> 01:27:46.051
This is not a dance competition.
It's like a brawl.

01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:50.931
The judge will likely take marks off,
but it sure is captivating.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:17.582
We come now to the result
of the 73rd World Championship,

01:28:17.583 --> 01:28:19.752
ballroom division.

01:28:20.253 --> 01:28:23.046
Into first place,

01:28:23.047 --> 01:28:26.801
Giulio Moretti and Liana Javalanka.

01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:41.189
Into second place,

01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:44.818
Shinya Sugiki and Fusako Yagami.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:58.875
Third, Dusan Novak and Valeria Orlova.

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:02.711
I remember
when he and Liana danced together

01:29:02.712 --> 01:29:04.629
before he paired up with Fusako.

01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:09.092
Their tango was so…
…passionate.

01:29:09.093 --> 01:29:15.516
Uh, I mean, it was obvious
that Shinya was crazy about Liana.

01:29:16.601 --> 01:29:19.978
But when he proposed to her,
something got in the way.

01:29:19.979 --> 01:29:21.313
So I hear.

01:29:21.314 --> 01:29:24.733
Giulio and Shinya's attack
is very similar.

01:29:24.734 --> 01:29:26.777
Their ability is evenly matched,

01:29:26.778 --> 01:29:31.198
or perhaps maybe there's just
the narrowest of margins between them.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:34.242
But the one who gets to stand
at the top of the podium is who?

01:29:34.243 --> 01:29:35.494
- Giulio.
- Giulio.

01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:38.663
Shinya doesn't have what it takes
to overcome that slight margin.

01:29:38.664 --> 01:29:41.583
- I'm sorry, Nino.
- No. I don't agree, Fabio. No, no, no.

01:29:41.584 --> 01:29:45.504
Everyone is here to see
his obsessive determination.

01:29:45.505 --> 01:29:46.421
I know.

01:29:46.422 --> 01:29:49.508
And everyone comes here
to see him valiantly struggle…

01:29:50.676 --> 01:29:52.969
…just to end up losing again.

01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:54.012
Yes.

01:29:54.013 --> 01:29:57.140
The only person here
who thinks he has a chance of winning

01:29:57.141 --> 01:29:59.852
is probably Shinya himself.

01:30:02.271 --> 01:30:04.065
What the hell are you saying?

01:30:04.649 --> 01:30:06.525
- Excuse me?
- Don't just say that.

01:30:06.526 --> 01:30:08.485
Do something about it!

01:30:08.486 --> 01:30:10.362
That "slight margin" you mentioned,

01:30:10.363 --> 01:30:13.366
you mean Sugiki's
actually a better dancer, right?

01:30:14.409 --> 01:30:18.203
- So help him win!
- Easy, calm down. Come on, Shinya, please.

01:30:18.204 --> 01:30:20.539
You guys have the power to do that,
don't you?

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:21.540
No, I… I don't know.

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:23.792
- I'm telling you, let him fucking win!
- Hey. Whoa, whoa!

01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:25.836
- Calm down.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:30:25.837 --> 01:30:27.045
- Easy.
- Sorry…

01:30:27.046 --> 01:30:28.505
- That's bullshit!
- I'm sorry.

01:30:28.506 --> 01:30:32.801
- But there's nothing we can do.
- I… I'm so sorry. So sorry.

01:30:32.802 --> 01:30:34.970
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:30:34.971 --> 01:30:39.391
next we have a very special honor dance.

01:30:39.392 --> 01:30:42.018
Please welcome to the floor

01:30:42.019 --> 01:30:44.689
Liana and Shinya.

01:30:50.027 --> 01:30:51.862
- Swapping partners?
- A switch!

01:30:51.863 --> 01:30:55.366
- Shinya and Liana? That's fantastic!
- That's fantastic!

01:31:10.339 --> 01:31:12.383
- Shinya!
- Shinya!

01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:51.046
This is a total charade,
but look at him.

01:31:51.047 --> 01:31:51.963
Mm.

01:31:51.964 --> 01:31:54.926
Sugiki plays the part
of the perfect gentleman.

01:31:55.843 --> 01:31:58.845
- You know, even I wanna be like him.
- I know what you mean.

01:31:58.846 --> 01:32:02.307
He's the ideal lover
that everyone wants to be.

01:32:02.308 --> 01:32:04.477
So true. So true.

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:38.214
That was a wonderful debut.

01:34:40.633 --> 01:34:42.134
Where is Ms. Tajima?

01:34:43.803 --> 01:34:46.639
- I don't know.
- I see.

01:35:06.867 --> 01:35:08.452
Didn't that bug you today?

01:35:10.579 --> 01:35:11.497
Ah.

01:35:12.123 --> 01:35:13.499
No, not at all.

01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:16.293
Liana and I were done a long time ago.

01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.463
You haven't moved on though.

01:35:24.427 --> 01:35:26.929
I can't stand that kinda thing.

01:35:29.265 --> 01:35:30.599
Being deceived.

01:35:33.102 --> 01:35:34.437
Betrayed.

01:35:38.607 --> 01:35:40.067
I can't forgive that.

01:35:51.662 --> 01:35:55.040
So you think I'm still in love with Liana?

01:35:57.001 --> 01:35:59.545
That I've never even looked
at another woman?

01:36:00.463 --> 01:36:03.632
That I've remained totally devoted to her?

01:36:05.885 --> 01:36:07.303
Is that what you saw?

01:36:09.638 --> 01:36:10.556
Well?

01:36:13.184 --> 01:36:15.727
If the audience saw a reunion
between two lovers,

01:36:15.728 --> 01:36:17.980
then tonight's show was a success.

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:22.818
No one was watching Giulio's performance
after that, were they?

01:36:26.197 --> 01:36:27.448
What do you mean?

01:36:30.201 --> 01:36:31.243
What?

01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:38.417
What the hell are you saying?

01:36:41.378 --> 01:36:43.088
You're really okay with it?

01:36:48.511 --> 01:36:50.678
I'm asking if that's really good enough…

01:36:50.679 --> 01:36:51.889
…for you!

01:37:04.276 --> 01:37:07.363
You said you wouldn't settle
for anything but first place.

01:38:01.333 --> 01:38:02.501
What's wrong?

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:05.796
What is it?

01:38:36.869 --> 01:38:38.954
I can't be with you anymore.

01:38:40.039 --> 01:38:42.583
If we go any further, it could destroy me.

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:47.463
What the fuck?

01:38:50.549 --> 01:38:53.969
- That's not it.
- No, stop! You're my enemy now.

01:38:57.723 --> 01:38:59.308
That's not true.

01:39:53.195 --> 01:39:54.446
In the end…

01:40:03.122 --> 01:40:05.249
you and I can never become one.

01:41:18.489 --> 01:41:19.448
Shit.

01:42:32.855 --> 01:42:33.814
Shinya.

01:43:08.223 --> 01:43:09.141
Shinya.

01:43:16.648 --> 01:43:18.025
I realized something.

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:23.947
I think I can do more for you.

01:43:29.578 --> 01:43:31.538
We can do more. I just know it.

01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:37.920
And even if it's just you…

01:43:41.131 --> 01:43:42.799
…you can go far!

01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:46.720
You could go as far as you want.

01:44:13.288 --> 01:44:14.289
Let's go.

01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:16.291
Huh?

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:18.752
What?

01:44:25.133 --> 01:44:27.134
The yellow is very nice.

01:44:27.135 --> 01:44:28.803
Isn't is amazing?

01:44:28.804 --> 01:44:31.180
This and…

01:44:31.181 --> 01:44:32.473
Ah!

01:44:32.474 --> 01:44:34.268
Hmm, no, no, no.

01:44:34.935 --> 01:44:35.851
Red.

01:44:35.852 --> 01:44:37.562
I wanna see you in red.

01:44:39.273 --> 01:44:42.651
- So you're gonna go with that?
- Yeah. Isn't it cool?

01:44:45.570 --> 01:44:49.156
Now, do we want it parted to this side?
Or to that side?

01:44:49.157 --> 01:44:51.451
Neater and more polished.

01:44:57.916 --> 01:45:00.960
So I want to show you
the beginning of Alemana.

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:03.421
We're going to do four to six.

01:45:03.422 --> 01:45:05.549
Let's do sliding doors.
Just the beginning.

01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:54.049
This is the first time
a dance competition in Japan

01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:56.093
has gotten this much media attention,
isn't it?

01:47:56.094 --> 01:47:57.554
Yeah, seems so.

01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:01.891
It's too bad Giulio and Alberto
aren't here though.

01:48:01.892 --> 01:48:04.769
They backed out.
Said they had a show to do.

01:48:05.687 --> 01:48:08.523
I say first place will go to Shinya.

01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:11.775
He'll place third at best.

01:48:11.776 --> 01:48:12.652
What?

01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:16.405
Well, why do you think the federation
put up the money

01:48:16.406 --> 01:48:19.033
and brought in so many foreign dancers?

01:48:19.034 --> 01:48:21.745
They're going to want
some kind of payback, you know?

01:48:24.122 --> 01:48:26.791
That's the dance world for ya, huh?

01:48:55.987 --> 01:48:58.907
Mr. Sugiki is the guest, right?

01:49:01.785 --> 01:49:03.411
So, he's here.

01:49:07.916 --> 01:49:09.834
I won't ever see him again

01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:12.170
outside of competition.

01:49:15.924 --> 01:49:18.009
When I saw him in Blackpool, it…

01:49:20.303 --> 01:49:22.013
it wasn't just dancing.

01:49:23.807 --> 01:49:26.184
The crowd and the other dancers…

01:49:28.311 --> 01:49:29.813
they were blown away by it.

01:49:34.859 --> 01:49:37.529
I wanna move the audience like that
every time.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.127
Five-minute call
for the finalists!

01:49:53.461 --> 01:49:55.964
Can I get everyone
to come together, please?

01:49:57.507 --> 01:49:59.801
All finalists, please come this way.

01:50:16.443 --> 01:50:22.031
The next event will be
the Professional Latin American final.

01:50:44.012 --> 01:50:46.431
So close, and yet so far.

01:51:35.438 --> 01:51:40.485
Dance is neither
about technique nor stamina.

01:51:44.239 --> 01:51:47.032
Love is what makes it whole.

01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:54.039
And once again,

01:51:54.040 --> 01:52:01.088
here are the 2026 Asian Cup
ballroom champions,

01:52:01.089 --> 01:52:06.593
Leonardo Fontana and Sofia Rossi!

01:52:08.972 --> 01:52:14.518
And the 2026
Asian Cup Latin champions,

01:52:14.519 --> 01:52:19.815
Alessandro Leon and Annamaria Valentini!

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:27.364
Please give our champions
another big round of applause.

01:52:30.952 --> 01:52:35.414
They will be back later
to perform an honor dance for us.

01:52:35.415 --> 01:52:40.587
And now, we have a demonstration
by our special guests,

01:52:41.212 --> 01:52:44.465
the UK ballroom champions,

01:52:44.466 --> 01:52:50.472
Shinya Sugiki and Fusako Yagami.

01:53:59.707 --> 01:54:01.376

A dance for love, the rumba.

01:58:45.409 --> 01:58:47.703

10 Dance.
