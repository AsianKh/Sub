00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.130
Well, um...

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.250
You're moving too much.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.650
I can’t even see your features.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.130
From this angle, I see it...

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.130
but now it’s gone.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.630
[Look over here]

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:36.450
[Natural]

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.330
Let me interview you.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.460
I heard you're good at shrimp fishing.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:42.580
I'm not that good.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.040
[Staring]

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.360
When I was little,

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:46.970
I fished somewhere else.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.450
It's all about luck.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.530
What about now?

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.050
My social skills.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:51.930
Social skills?

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.690
Specifically, my "shrimp diplomacy."

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.190
[THAI SWEET]

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:04.650
Let's get out of the car.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.610
Fishing shrimp

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.380
[Arrived at the shrimp fishing place]

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.310
Shrimp fishing.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:08.730
Watch your head.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.290
Shrimp fishing:
the moment I've been waiting for!

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.280
Where is it?

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:15.070
Who do you think
will catch one first among us three?

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.090
[Preview of the next episode]

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:17.930
It should be me.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.450
It should be me.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.130
That's impressive.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.530
If I don't catch even one,

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:29.410
I'll be really upset.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:29.970
No way.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:30.770
Just wait, Mu.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.030
I'll catch one for you.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.180
Did you catch anything?

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.250
It's bleeding.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.520
