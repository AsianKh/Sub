WEBVTT

00:46.320 --> 00:53.200
THE TANK

00:55.480 --> 00:58.440
SOVIET UNION, DNIEPER FRONT, AUTUMN 1943.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.080
EIGHT MONTHS AFTER STALINGRAD,
THE GERMAN ARMY IS IN RETREAT.

01:03.560 --> 01:04.640
Withdraw!

01:04.720 --> 01:07.000
Go! Go! Go! Move!

01:08.400 --> 01:12.120
- Take up position behind the bridge.
- Faster!

01:13.000 --> 01:14.240
Hurry!

01:15.200 --> 01:16.600
Retreat!

01:17.840 --> 01:19.480
Fall back!

01:30.680 --> 01:33.880
- Second unit, cross the bridge!
- Move!

01:59.520 --> 02:02.880
<i>Commander, our troops have retreated.</i>

02:08.600 --> 02:11.360
<i>Lieutenant. Should we retreat, too?</i>

02:15.480 --> 02:16.760
Lieutenant!

02:36.480 --> 02:38.560
<i>Keilig, any enemy radio?</i>

02:46.840 --> 02:48.000
There they are.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.080
Soviet T-34s. I see them!

03:35.840 --> 03:38.680
- 600. On target!
- Ready for firing.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.200
Give the order, Lieutenant.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.360
Philip!

04:12.280 --> 04:13.160
Philip.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.960
- Fire.
- Achtung!

04:23.080 --> 04:24.800
Hit. Destroyed.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.160
Loaded!

04:28.840 --> 04:30.560
- Infantry between!
- Machine Gun, fire!

04:40.120 --> 04:42.080
To the right! More tanks.

04:44.000 --> 04:44.960
- On target.
- Fire!

04:45.040 --> 04:45.880
Achtung!

04:49.200 --> 04:50.680
Hit.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.480
- Destroyed.
- Loaded!

04:52.560 --> 04:53.760
Fire MG! Keep on them!

05:09.200 --> 05:12.160
We've destroyed the two in the front
and blocked the way.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.920
- Let's get out of here!
- Fire!

05:16.240 --> 05:17.240
Achtung!

05:21.800 --> 05:24.720
Philip, did you hear me?
We can avoid them.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.680
- Fire!
- Achtung!

05:30.920 --> 05:32.800
- Loaded.
- More keep coming.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.160
- We're blowing up the bridge at midnight.
- In five minutes.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.080
We've still got time. Fire!

05:40.840 --> 05:42.240
Achtung!

05:47.200 --> 05:48.160
We need to move. Now!

05:48.240 --> 05:51.240
- We've got four and a half minutes.
- The bridge is 600 meters long.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.560
Anti-tank gun, twelve o'clock!

05:54.640 --> 05:55.840
- I have to reload.
- Fire!

05:56.400 --> 05:57.600
I've got it.

05:59.840 --> 06:00.920
Achtung!

06:03.080 --> 06:04.200
Loaded.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.200
We're alone and out of time, Philip.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.120
Give the order.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.160
Give the order, Philip!

06:15.080 --> 06:18.120
Retreat. Hummel, back across the bridge.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.240
<i>Yes, Commander.</i>

06:32.120 --> 06:33.600
Go, go, go!

06:33.680 --> 06:35.000
Go, Hummel!

06:35.560 --> 06:38.480
Go! Four minutes left. Four minutes!

06:45.960 --> 06:47.320
Faster, Hummel.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.760
We won't make it!

07:02.880 --> 07:05.880
They're not following us anymore.
And they've stopped firing.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.680
- They must know we're going to blow it up.
- We'll make it.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.160
- Ilyushins!
- They can't harm us.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.040
- Commander...
- Fire!

07:33.120 --> 07:35.560
It's getting in. Fire's getting in!

07:38.400 --> 07:40.280
I'm on fire! I'm on fire!

07:40.360 --> 07:42.720
Move, Helmut, move!

07:44.440 --> 07:45.680
Fire!

07:47.040 --> 07:49.200
Go, Helmut! Keep going. Go!

07:49.280 --> 07:50.480
Move, Helmut!

07:50.560 --> 07:51.560
Hit it!

07:54.080 --> 07:57.120
I think we're going to make it, Philip!
We're going to make it!

09:01.080 --> 09:03.120
<i>We're alone and out of time, Philip.</i>

09:04.120 --> 09:05.440
<i>Give the order.</i>

09:06.200 --> 09:07.600
<i>Ilyushins!</i>

09:07.680 --> 09:10.040
<i>I'm on fire! I'm on fire!</i>

09:24.840 --> 09:27.120
PERVITIN
AMPHETAMINES

09:45.120 --> 09:46.320
When do we get there?

09:57.280 --> 09:58.560
CLASSIFIED

10:00.760 --> 10:05.280
24TH TANK CORPS

10:18.080 --> 10:20.360
ORDER FOR EXECUTION
OF OPERATION LABYRINTH

10:22.640 --> 10:25.120
INDIVIDUAL ORDER:
LIEUTENANT GERKENS, 3RD COMPANY...

10:25.200 --> 10:27.320
<i>Unescorted...</i>

10:27.400 --> 10:30.920
BRING COL. VON HARDENBURG
WITH CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS BACK TO HQ...

10:31.880 --> 10:33.160
<i>Paul?</i>

11:13.760 --> 11:15.280
Give me a hand.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.600
Turn it on.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.440
Pass it up.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.280
Lieutenant.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.560
Welcome back.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.120
- Thanks, Christian.
- Men!

11:44.200 --> 11:45.320
Lieutenant.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.440
Lieutenant.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.360
Boss.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.160
How's our Tiger?

11:54.720 --> 11:56.200
Battered and bruised.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.000
But ready for action.

11:58.840 --> 11:59.880
Good.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.240
And you?

12:04.440 --> 12:07.920
Same. A few scrapes and burns.
Nothing too serious.

12:12.640 --> 12:13.920
New orders?

12:14.520 --> 12:15.960
Unfortunately, yes.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.880
Colonel Richter
wants us to move out today.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.320
- And what about our leave?
- Cancelled.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.520
Today?

12:25.080 --> 12:25.960
Today.

12:26.440 --> 12:27.880
Where to?

12:27.960 --> 12:29.880
Back to the east. Over the Psel.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.640
- To Ivan country?
- In between.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.680
Into no-man's land.

12:36.240 --> 12:40.280
Our orders are to locate the whereabouts
of Colonel von Hardenburg

12:40.360 --> 12:41.880
and to bring him back.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.320
Von Hardenburg? I thought he was dead.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.560
I thought so too.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.040
But many probably think we are too.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.440
- Which unit will accompany us?
- None.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.520
The order is top secret.

12:53.600 --> 12:57.120
He's presumably in one of our bunker
complexes east of Novyi Yar.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.040
Shit.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.880
- Why us?
- Orders are orders.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.560
If we'd needed to know,
they'd have told us.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.160
But a single Tiger tank...

13:09.240 --> 13:12.320
They must believe
if someone can do it, we can.

13:14.680 --> 13:16.360
Get the tank ready.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.080
Let's go, men.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.760
Let's go.

13:40.160 --> 13:43.240
<i>Wolf to Fox's Den,
we're off to the labyrinth for 48 hours.</i>

13:45.280 --> 13:46.400
<i>Wolf over and out.</i>

14:29.600 --> 14:30.440
Helmut.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.280
Give me a light!

14:41.520 --> 14:43.360
Greatest tank ever built

14:43.440 --> 14:46.600
and the driver can't stick his head out
or see anything.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.960
And you assholes
get the sun on your faces.

14:49.040 --> 14:53.280
The builders knew what ugly bastards
you drivers are!

15:30.720 --> 15:32.000
<i>Von Hardenburg?</i>

15:32.080 --> 15:35.440
But he stayed in Stalingrad
with the Sixth after we were pulled out.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.280
<i>A miracle he survived the fighting.</i>

15:38.360 --> 15:40.840
I heard he cut off his own hand.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.040
<i>I heard that, too.</i>

15:42.120 --> 15:45.160
He was buried
under the tractor factory rubble.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.720
<i>His hand was trapped.</i>

15:46.800 --> 15:48.080
After five days,

15:49.080 --> 15:51.360
he had to cut it off with a knife.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.520
To survive.

15:52.600 --> 15:53.840
I told you.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.920
Helmut, I still have your lighter.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.520
<i>But it's mine now.</i>

16:00.200 --> 16:02.640
If he survived, he must be a Russian spy.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.040
That must be why they want him back.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.720
Apparently he crawled out of the rubble

16:08.800 --> 16:12.040
<i>and a young lady
took pity on him and hid him.</i>

16:12.120 --> 16:15.520
Later, he made his way back to our side
disguised as a farmer.

16:15.600 --> 16:19.440
And they sent his ass back to the front
with just one hand?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.000
I almost feel sorry for him.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.040
Now they're sending our asses
after him to bring him back.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.960
Sounds even more like a Russian spy.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.800
Field officers, all one-handed artists.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.760
What makes him so important?
The "von" in his name?

16:34.840 --> 16:38.720
The mission order says he was working
on a secret disengagement plan.

16:40.360 --> 16:44.000
It contains all our positions,
radio codes and weapons supplies.

16:44.080 --> 16:48.440
If it falls into Russian hands,
the gates to the Reich will be wide open.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.400
Our mission has the code name
Operation Labyrinth.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.560
Didn't they try to reach him by radio?

17:02.920 --> 17:05.880
He hasn't answered
since we blew up the bridge.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.320
In Stalingrad...

17:12.920 --> 17:14.320
<i>Those were his orders, right?</i>

17:15.720 --> 17:18.240
He was the commanding officer, yes.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.680
What you got there, squirt?

17:46.760 --> 17:49.120
No one-handed shenanigans in my tank!

17:50.720 --> 17:52.160
I wasn't doing anything.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.640
I clearly saw it.

18:05.640 --> 18:09.120
<i>Five kilometers to the front.
Keep your eyes peeled after that.</i>

19:03.600 --> 19:07.320
<i>- Weller, what's all that about?
- Probably to confuse the Russians.</i>

19:08.080 --> 19:10.280
Looks like the plan's to retreat further.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.120
I thought Adolf the Austrian
didn't believe in retreat.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.320
One of yours, Weller.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.760
- Not the kind I know.
- You on your Tyrolean pig farm.

19:18.840 --> 19:22.080
First of all, it's not a pig farm.
It's a vineyard.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.560
And it's the Wachau.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.840
The most beautiful place in the world.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.800
- Wachau!
- Keilig, anything on the radio?

19:33.920 --> 19:35.280
All I'm getting is static.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.360
Maybe that's better.
Then Ivan can't listen in.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.960
Hummel, we'll leave the road in 50 meters.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.360
45 degrees to the left,
away from the open field.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.600
- I want to be in cover by nightfall.
- Yes, Sir!

20:07.960 --> 20:11.400
Drink up and put out the fire.
You and I will take first watch, Michel.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.720
Are there partisans around?

20:34.640 --> 20:35.760
You never know.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.240
Better keep our eyes and ears open.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.560
Bodhana always said...

20:50.400 --> 20:52.480
these woods are full of ghosts.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.080
Who's Bodhana?

20:54.160 --> 20:56.880
A peasant girl he met back in Tolokonnoye.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.480
She sold us milk and eggs.

20:59.560 --> 21:02.680
- And the clap too, right, squirt?
- Helmut!

21:03.600 --> 21:06.360
- I didn't sleep with her.
- But you would've liked to.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.480
Listen to Uncle Helmut, squirt.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.560
A moment of fun, a lifetime of regret.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.080
And she said these woods
are full of ghosts?

21:18.040 --> 21:23.160
Yes, that the souls of the dead
roam those woods.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.200
The Ukrainians believe that.

21:26.920 --> 21:28.680
So do lots of people back home in Silesia.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.680
Silesia's just one big pig farm.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.440
Why didn't we burn to death, Lieutenant?

21:41.480 --> 21:42.760
On the bridge.

21:44.320 --> 21:47.840
We only made it because I kept
my foot on the gas till the end.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.680
Even though it was on fire.
You all owe me a new pair of boots.

22:00.040 --> 22:02.760
You know von Hardenburg well,
don't you, Lieutenant?

22:04.280 --> 22:06.320
We went to military academy together.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.200
You were friends?

22:09.160 --> 22:10.920
Yes, but that was long ago.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.760
Is it true that he's your son's godfather?

22:24.720 --> 22:27.000
Enough for now. Go sleep.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.960
Will-o'-the-wisp.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.960
Don't let Hummel get to you.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.120
He's got it in for me.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.600
He lost his son.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.000
He was only 15.

23:41.960 --> 23:45.560
He manned the Humboldthain Flak tower
during an air raid.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.680
It was a direct hit.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.600
Hummel had to bury an empty coffin.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.600
Maybe it's his way of showing you
you matter to him.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.200
Get some rest.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.040
I'll take over the watch.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.320
<i>Philip.</i>

25:28.280 --> 25:29.480
What do you hear?

25:37.800 --> 25:39.720
Out with it. What do you hear?

25:40.560 --> 25:41.480
It's Latin.

25:43.720 --> 25:44.920
Listen to this.

25:47.720 --> 25:51.320
"Lamb of God, have mercy on us."

25:54.640 --> 25:58.000
"Lamb of God, who takes away the sins..."

26:03.680 --> 26:07.120
"Lamb of God, give us eternal rest."

26:14.560 --> 26:16.040
It's mass.

26:16.760 --> 26:19.960
- It's always on the radio at home too.
- They're Orthodox here.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.000
Why would they listen to a Latin mass?

26:31.880 --> 26:33.920
Anti-tank barriers. Stay on the right.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.040
Ivan probably wants to shake us.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.000
Turn off that hocus-pocus.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.720
Who built that?

26:56.800 --> 27:01.880
We did. Or rather what was left
of Zhukov's army after we captured them.

27:05.960 --> 27:08.480
Those who were too weak
are buried under that.

27:35.080 --> 27:39.000
<i>Hummel, there's a gap in the barrier.
We'll go through it. Left stick.</i>

28:18.360 --> 28:19.200
Tank halt!

28:27.200 --> 28:28.800
- What is it?
- Mines!

28:28.880 --> 28:31.560
- Engine off.
- Shit.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.800
What do we do now?

28:36.280 --> 28:37.840
Michel, Keilig, down.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.680
We have to search the ground.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.840
Careful. Jump onto our own tracks.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.240
Thoroughly!

29:33.800 --> 29:34.720
Shit. Michel!

29:40.280 --> 29:41.320
Come here.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.080
It's too close to the tread.
We'll have to dig it out.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.720
You'll help me. Keilig!

29:50.800 --> 29:54.080
Check the ground next to our tracks
in case we need to back up.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.800
- Yes, Sir!
- Lieutenant.

29:56.400 --> 29:59.360
Nine o'clock. 3,000 meters.
Dust on the horizon.

29:59.440 --> 30:02.360
- Could be an ambush.
- Keep an eye on it, Christian.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.840
Help me.

30:05.680 --> 30:06.880
There.

30:12.480 --> 30:16.120
Clear the earth from underneath the mine
so we can lift it up.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.360
I'll try to unscrew the detonator. Go on.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.040
Careful.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.840
Damn, I can't see anything.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.800
We have to lift it.

30:51.560 --> 30:52.480
Carefully.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.400
- Lieutenant!
- What?

30:59.480 --> 31:02.000
Something moved. I'm holding it.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.480
It feels like a hand grenade.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.520
It's true.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.880
Bastards. They took the safety pins out.
It's a double booby trap.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.640
If you move your hands,

31:16.720 --> 31:18.800
the grenade will move
and activate the detonator

31:18.880 --> 31:21.320
and both of us will blow up with the mine.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.600
You need to keep calm, Michel.

31:24.680 --> 31:25.640
Michel!

31:26.720 --> 31:28.040
Michel.

31:29.560 --> 31:30.720
Here.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.040
Breathe.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.320
Good.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.440
Yes, Sir.

31:46.400 --> 31:49.480
- Weller, what's the status?
- Vehicles seem to be moving away.

31:49.560 --> 31:51.280
Prepare to backtrack!

31:51.360 --> 31:52.720
What's going on?

31:53.280 --> 31:56.280
First I'll move them to safety,
then I'll come back for you.

31:56.360 --> 31:57.560
Understood?

32:02.080 --> 32:03.400
Understood.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.160
Unknown vehicles
at five to six kilometers.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.840
Moving away.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.800
- Hummel!
- Where's Michel?

32:21.880 --> 32:24.640
Slowly reverse the Tiger
on our old tracks.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.720
- Where's Michel?
- The Tiger is our priority.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.240
Start moving!

33:00.080 --> 33:01.400
Straight.

33:08.640 --> 33:09.560
<i>Straight.</i>

33:13.840 --> 33:15.840
Jesus fucking Christ! The little squirt.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.120
Straight, I said!

33:25.440 --> 33:26.640
<i>Halt!</i>

33:40.000 --> 33:40.880
Rope.

33:43.040 --> 33:46.440
- You're doing great, Michel! Really great.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.880
I'm going to get you...

34:09.600 --> 34:11.000
home safely.

34:14.960 --> 34:15.800
Careful!

34:24.960 --> 34:28.720
Now listen to me carefully, Michel.
Look at me.

34:31.040 --> 34:35.080
You're going to slowly slide
your hand out, little by little.

34:35.640 --> 34:39.880
So that the weight of the mine
presses down on the grenade's detonator.

34:42.600 --> 34:43.600
Go.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.200
Slowly.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.080
Keep moving, slowly.

34:51.160 --> 34:52.400
Slower.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.560
Very good, Michel. Very good.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.680
Keep going.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.320
Slowly.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.480
Keep going.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.440
Carefully.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.160
Keep going. Good.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.520
Careful.

35:58.200 --> 35:59.120
Get up.

36:01.880 --> 36:03.040
Come on.

36:15.360 --> 36:16.200
Come on.

36:27.120 --> 36:28.400
Everyone down.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.280
Get behind the tank!

36:44.280 --> 36:46.000
This one is yours.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.240
- You've got nerves of steel.
- Mount up.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.480
Great job.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.320
You'll get no hugs from me, squirt.

37:28.080 --> 37:32.040
But I'll let you hang that picture
of your girlfriend up in my tank.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.920
<i>Hummel, sharp left!</i>

39:02.800 --> 39:03.920
Halt!

39:14.320 --> 39:16.600
Tank at twelve o'clock.
Backwards. Start moving!

39:20.720 --> 39:22.320
Sharp left. Hurry!

39:27.280 --> 39:28.320
<i>Smoke grenades.</i>

39:34.000 --> 39:34.960
Straight!

39:37.040 --> 39:38.760
<i>Hummel, we need more distance.</i>

39:38.840 --> 39:40.920
Out of the woods. Step on it!

39:45.480 --> 39:47.120
<i>And halt!</i>

39:53.680 --> 39:56.600
<i>That was a heavy caliber tank.
SU-100, I'd guess.</i>

39:56.680 --> 39:59.840
Tank Killer.
One hit with his shot and we're finished.

40:05.480 --> 40:06.320
Lieutenant.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.280
<i>More are coming.</i>

40:11.360 --> 40:13.640
<i>At least three more tanks.
We'll avoid them.</i>

40:13.720 --> 40:15.600
We can stay here
and take them on one by one.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.960
<i>There are too many.
We can't jeopardize the mission!</i>

40:18.040 --> 40:21.840
We're stuck between them and the river.
Attacking is our only chance.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.280
<i>They've got us trapped.</i>

40:24.360 --> 40:25.800
<i>The river!</i>

40:26.360 --> 40:27.440
We've got a chance.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.360
Reverse. Then east, three o'clock.

41:09.560 --> 41:10.520
Halt.

41:12.680 --> 41:13.840
Engine off.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.520
<i>Philip, what are you doing?</i>

41:16.080 --> 41:17.400
Everyone out.

41:22.920 --> 41:24.160
What the hell?

41:27.960 --> 41:29.040
Move!

41:30.600 --> 41:32.160
Prepare the tank to dive.

41:34.080 --> 41:36.320
- What?
- The Tiger is built to dive.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.720
- We've only done that in training.
- Move!

41:38.800 --> 41:40.040
Never in combat!

41:41.240 --> 41:43.120
Seems like the right time to do so.

41:43.200 --> 41:46.120
We've taken several bad hits.
We might sink like a stone.

41:46.200 --> 41:49.400
You repaired it, and I trust you.
Get moving.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.360
Move! Go, go, go!

42:04.560 --> 42:05.640
Perfect.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.680
Everyone inside.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.480
Hummel, start engine.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.040
WATER DRIVE

42:36.080 --> 42:37.560
<i>Start moving! Out of here.</i>

42:37.640 --> 42:38.720
CLOSE

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
Submerging.

43:55.600 --> 43:57.000
Hummel, stop.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.680
It feels really loud.

44:09.560 --> 44:11.200
- Can't we turn off the engine?
- No.

44:11.280 --> 44:14.920
- No.
- If it doesn't restart, you'll drown here.

44:18.280 --> 44:21.680
But they can see our exhaust. Engine off!

44:21.760 --> 44:23.960
What? If it doesn't restart, we're goners.

44:24.520 --> 44:25.400
Off.

44:51.600 --> 44:53.080
What's the situation?

44:54.560 --> 44:55.680
Holding tight for now.

44:59.240 --> 45:00.280
Here too.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.040
No water to report.

45:12.480 --> 45:14.320
How long can we stay underwater?

45:35.360 --> 45:36.600
Engine sounds.

45:43.360 --> 45:45.000
They're coming closer.

45:45.080 --> 45:47.240
Burning in a tank is one thing.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.640
But drowning...

45:53.720 --> 45:57.400
Weller was right.
We should have faced them in the field.

45:58.080 --> 46:00.000
- We're sitting ducks!
- Quiet.

46:48.400 --> 46:50.680
We'll stay submerged
to be on the safe side.

47:14.640 --> 47:16.040
How long do you want to wait?

47:16.600 --> 47:21.920
Until I'm sure we're not
walking into a trap once we emerge.

47:41.360 --> 47:43.240
Keilig, what time have you got?

47:44.200 --> 47:46.640
Nearly 12,
but it's stopped since the bridge.

47:51.800 --> 47:55.040
Bodhana told me
there's a merman in the lakes.

47:55.760 --> 47:57.960
He pulls you down into the deep
when you go swimming.

47:59.800 --> 48:02.920
What a cheery soul, your "Spatzl."

48:03.720 --> 48:05.480
- Huh?
- Shut up!

48:07.040 --> 48:08.280
Right now.

49:02.760 --> 49:03.800
<i>Philip!</i>

49:19.080 --> 49:21.960
- Lieutenant!
- Shit, we're leaking!

49:22.040 --> 49:24.560
We need to surface,
whether they're there or not.

49:26.320 --> 49:29.600
All right. We'll cross the river
and surface on the other side.

49:29.680 --> 49:32.200
- Cross the river?
- They could still be nearby.

49:32.280 --> 49:35.040
It's safer. And not looking for a bridge
will save us fuel.

49:35.120 --> 49:36.920
Helmut! Start the engine!

49:48.560 --> 49:49.600
Shit.

49:49.680 --> 49:50.960
Again! Again!

49:51.040 --> 49:53.560
Go on! Go on, Hummel!

50:04.280 --> 50:06.320
Come on, Helmut! Again!

50:14.120 --> 50:15.000
Yes!

50:17.160 --> 50:19.040
Helmut, start moving!

50:30.560 --> 50:34.120
If we get stuck down here, we won't even
be able to get our hatches open.

50:34.680 --> 50:37.200
- I can't swim.
- I can't either.

50:37.800 --> 50:41.440
We won't need to either,
we'll die in an iron coffin.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.000
Halt, engine off.

51:53.800 --> 51:56.560
Nothing in sight. Everyone out.

52:25.960 --> 52:28.240
Let's get our little Tiger ready again.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.520
We only have enough fuel
for 20 kilometers.

52:32.960 --> 52:34.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

52:37.040 --> 52:37.880
Shit.

52:38.440 --> 52:39.480
What?

52:40.040 --> 52:42.160
Ivan owes me a new one.

52:45.280 --> 52:46.280
That was close.

52:46.360 --> 52:48.440
Come on. We've got a mission to complete.

53:45.800 --> 53:47.720
<i>Better take your tank candy.</i>

53:48.680 --> 53:50.200
It's going to be a long night.

53:51.280 --> 53:53.200
<i>And I want you to stay wide awake.</i>

54:25.200 --> 54:27.360
I'd rather keep a clear head.

55:22.560 --> 55:23.640
Halt.

55:26.480 --> 55:27.840
<i>Engine off.</i>

55:33.480 --> 55:34.800
What's going on?

55:54.120 --> 55:55.600
They're ours.

55:57.640 --> 55:59.480
Start engine. Keep moving.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.840
Engine off. Dismount.

57:16.400 --> 57:18.120
Move it! Down!

57:30.040 --> 57:31.120
Heil Hitler.

57:31.640 --> 57:33.160
Tank boys.

57:37.320 --> 57:38.800
Go on! Faster.

57:39.880 --> 57:41.600
Hurry up!

57:45.360 --> 57:46.920
Hurry up, men.

57:47.480 --> 57:49.120
The horses too!

57:53.240 --> 57:56.160
Lieutenant Gerkens,
Heavy Tank Battalion 503.

57:57.320 --> 57:59.160
Requesting fuel.

57:59.240 --> 58:00.640
Lieutenant Colonel Krebs.

58:01.840 --> 58:03.520
What happened? Took a wrong turn?

58:05.600 --> 58:06.640
Special mission.

58:07.280 --> 58:10.400
You tank boys, always special!

58:13.240 --> 58:16.080
I was told we didn't have
any more troops here.

58:17.200 --> 58:19.640
This is our special mission.

58:19.720 --> 58:22.880
Cleaning up all the villages
that helped the partisans.

58:22.960 --> 58:25.600
Move! Move!

58:25.680 --> 58:29.160
You're sending them to work camps?

58:30.480 --> 58:32.720
The time for work camps is long over.

58:33.480 --> 58:34.880
We lock the door.

58:34.960 --> 58:38.640
When we set it on fire,
their animals kick them to death.

58:38.720 --> 58:39.920
Saves ammunition.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.040
Our little contribution
to the great cause.

58:42.600 --> 58:45.480
The Reich's hunger for death is so great

58:46.600 --> 58:48.600
that it can't produce enough ammunition.

58:52.360 --> 58:54.440
It looks like we're almost done here.

58:59.040 --> 59:00.160
Pack it up, men.

59:34.800 --> 59:36.720
You remember the flames, don't you?

59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.480
So, my work here is done.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.120
Oh, and as for your fuel...

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.040
Move out!

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:19.240
Let's get out of here right away.
We'll sleep in the Tiger tonight.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.560
Move out!

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.800
Philip.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.760
To hell with that.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.280
Michel, give me something stronger!

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.760
More.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.320
Nectar of the Gods.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.000
I thought you were a winemaker.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.760
Even a simple Latin teacher like me
knows it's complete piss.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.880
'37 Baron von Claussen.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.680
Emerald Grüner Veltliner.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.120
Best vintage I ever made.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.800
Subtle fruit
with carefully balanced acidity and...

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.080
delicate apricot notes.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.360
We called it "Nectar of the Gods."

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.120
Marshal Göring liked it so much
he bought half the vintage.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.200
And now all that's left of it...

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.400
is a memory.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.800
And I have no choice
but to drink this piss.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.880
Piss or not,

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.840
it does what it's meant to do.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.040
Lieutenant?

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.600
How does an Austrian peasant learn
to make wine fit for the Reichsmarschall?

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.800
In the Wachau.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.600
Winemaking's in our blood.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.440
My father taught me,
and his father taught him.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.920
If you made the wine,
who is this Baron von Claussen?

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.720
I was his winemaker.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.080
Well, then it's your wine.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.720
His land, his grapes.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.000
His sun, his wind, his rain?

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.360
For an old Latin teacher,
you sure sound like a Red again, Keilig.

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.760
If the ancient Romans
handed down one thing to us,

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:05.280
if they made one great contribution
to human knowledge, it's war.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.440
They waged it eternally.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.720
To subjugate their own people,
not the enemy.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.880
Keep fighting, keep waging war,
never any peace.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.880
So the Latin teacher, the winemaker,
the train driver and the farm boy join in.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.440
There's no choice. "Yes, Sir. No, Sir."
Orders must be followed.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.360
Forget who you were
and what you once loved.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.360
We follow orders
to protect the people we love.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.960
Orders are the only thing we have.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.800
Without them, everything falls apart.
The army, society, everything.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.760
No place for politics in my tank!

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.320
Besides, you're wrong.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.120
The ancient Romans
didn't have train drivers.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.320
Even I know that.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.120
And you don't know much.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.200
Hey. Shut up!

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.480
To the train drivers!

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.720
The saviors of society!

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.160
Weller. Lighter.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.360
I don't know what you mean.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.560
I wish I could forget.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.240
Forget who we once were.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.320
It'll never be like it used to be.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.400
How can it be?

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.040
After all this.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.600
Who we once were?

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.960
We're still the same.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:48.760
We followed orders.
And we did what was demanded of us.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.200
That's all.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.280
When all of this is over, then...

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.960
visit me in Austria
and I'll show you my vineyard.

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.600
And we'll drink a bottle together.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.480
We'll do that.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.640
Halt!

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.720
What is it?

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.160
<i>I don't like this.</i>

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.640
<i>Let's keep our distance.</i>

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:56.760
<i>The bunker's straight behind it
and we can't afford to take a detour.</i>

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.280
<i>Ready for combat.</i>

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.000
Range?

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.720
<i>1,000.</i>

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.040
<i>Helmut, pass the mill on the left side,
but slowly.</i>

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.200
- On target.
- Start moving.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:31.120
<i>Must have been used for target practice.</i>

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.640
We're entering range.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.440
Keilig, MG!

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.600
<i>Fire at will.</i>

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.600
Damn sun! Keep your eyes peeled!

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.720
Halt! Gunfire at one o'clock!

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.040
Hummel, back up now! Move, move!

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.800
<i>Weller, return fire.</i>

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:07.920
That was close!

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.720
<i>- Hummel, keep moving.
- Yes, Sir!</i>

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.400
Keilig, fire MG!

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.240
Out of the line of fire! To the left!

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.040
<i>Faster, Hummel!</i>

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.320
Halt!

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:26.120
Weller, next to the mill sail.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.000
<i>Where it's collapsed. 900.</i>

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:29.680
Identified.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.160
- On target.
- Unlocked!

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.360
Fire!

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:44.600
Nothing in sight. Hit doubtful.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.800
<i>What?</i>

01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.880
<i>An SU-100.</i>

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:02.520
- Is it the same one?
<i>- What the...</i>

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.880
This can't be. What the hell?

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.520
<i>- Must've followed us.
- That's impossible!</i>

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.120
Avoid him, Hummel.
Keilig, keep him covered.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.200
Start moving! Fire!

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.840
- Fire!
- Achtung!

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.480
<i>It ricocheted off.
The armor is far too strong.</i>

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.240
Loaded!

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.720
More distance.
We have to get them from the side.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.360
<i>- Shit!
- That was the exhaust pipe!</i>

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.680
- Damn it!
<i>- Reverse, full speed, Hummel.</i>

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.920
Smoke grenades.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:02.600
Where are you?

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.480
- Pierced clean through!
- You okay?

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.560
- Yes.
- It's turning around.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.480
Shit!

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.000
Philip, they're too strong!

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:26.240
<i>Yes, but it's just a giant gun on chains.
We're faster, more agile.</i>

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.120
They have to turn the whole tank to fire.

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.080
<i>Hummel, move forward slowly.</i>

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.160
Left stick. I want to offer him our flank.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.240
- What about our flank?
<i>- Trust me.</i>

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.280
Move!

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.040
<i>Gun to three o'clock.</i>

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.360
We'll be right in their barrel.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.400
Keep your nerve!

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:01.960
Lieutenant!

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:02.920
Keep your nerve.

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.560
The Russians will have us soon.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.760
<i>MG! Distract them.</i>

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.080
Halt!

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.240
Come on, Philip!

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.680
- On target!
- Hold.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.880
I've got him.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.160
<i>Hold.</i>

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.200
<i>Stop MG.</i>

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.040
- Fire.
- Achtung!

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.400
Hit. Destroyed.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.000
The problem with those tanks is

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.960
they can't see
what's right in front of them.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.200
We should've attacked them in the woods!

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.160
That damn tank nearly destroyed us!

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.600
Keilig?

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.080
- Keilig, you all right?
- Keilig!

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.960
- Keilig...
- Keilig, you bastard!

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.880
- Lieutenant!
- Are you hit, Keilig?

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.240
Shrapnel.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.200
My lungs.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.080
Shit!

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.080
Take me into the sun.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.200
Lay him on the roof.

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.800
Take his legs.

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.360
Careful.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.640
It's all okay, Keilig. It's okay.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:10.760
You and Hardenburg...
it's personal, isn't it?

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.400
Try not to talk.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.520
Write...

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.200
Write to Luise and the girls.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.680
I'll do that. I promise.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.800
I wanted to teach again.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.400
In '39 I had...

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.400
a senior class.

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.880
One of the loveliest summers.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.480
After that...

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.960
there was only war.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.120
I...

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.560
Keilig.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.640
Let's check the Tiger.

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.880
We can patch this one up, but...

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.360
Lieutenant!

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.520
What?

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.720
Damn.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.520
Bodies don't burn that fast.

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.160
Enough.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.120
We go back to base and tell them
we didn't find von Hardenburg.

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.560
Something's not right here.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.760
It's only another 20 kilometers.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.480
Our exhaust pipe is shot.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.880
We can repair it, with parts from the SU.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.520
We only have fuel for 30 kilometers.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.520
- That won't even get us back!
- There'll be supplies in the bunker.

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.960
I hope von Hardenburg is worth all this.

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.280
But if he's a spy, I'll put a bullet
through his head myself.

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.480
To work.

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.280
Move.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.240
<i>You remember the flames, don't you?</i>

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:23.480
Lieutenant?

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.240
Keil...

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.200
Michel, check the radio.

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.640
Lieutenant.

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.080
Turn it off.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.040
Off!

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:19.920
How much longer?

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.680
How long do you want to keep going?

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.520
Until we've found him
and brought him home.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.880
Home?

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.200
It isn't a home.

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.280
<i>They're just our fucking lines.</i>

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.480
Until we retreat to the next lines.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:42.320
And then to the next and the next!

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:45.640
Why is von Hardenburg so important?

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.640
Are they afraid he'll defect?

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.000
<i>Maybe Keilig was right.</i>

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.720
That he already has and we're...

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.840
walking into a trap.

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.120
Or is he only important to you?

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.000
<i>Keilig was right.</i>

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.960
He said it was personal
between you and von Hardenburg.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.200
Why are you dragging us into it?

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.440
- Why?
- They're orders.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:33.280
If the Russians find him, they'll have
our positions, frequencies, tactics...

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:36.760
Then the gates to the Reich
will be wide open. I know, Philip!

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.360
But we're wide open to attack too!

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.440
The enemy knows we're here.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.800
Philip! Don't you get that?

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.320
<i>Please wake up!</i>

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.680
I think you've taken unnecessary risks.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.800
And you've been compromised.

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:04.360
I vote to relieve you
of command until we get back.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:13.800
All right.

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.800
All of you decide.

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.920
Now.

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:22.400
Michel?

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.000
I'm with the Lieutenant.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.240
Helmut?

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.680
You're the driver.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.000
This is your tank.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.800
<i>You've been with us since Barbarossa.</i>

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.600
I mean... Keilig's dead.

01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:58.680
Exactly.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:04.320
And... on the bridge and while diving,

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.840
you took risks.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.040
I'm sorry.

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.120
Weller...

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.440
I'm with the Commander.

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:50.040
We won't speak of this again.

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:55.720
According to the map, there's an old path
to the forest where the bunker is.

01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.720
Seems to be 45 degrees
to the left, Hummel.

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:19.760
<i>Philip.</i>

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.680
Tank halt!

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.520
What?

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:56.160
<i>Footprints. Everyone dismount.</i>

01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.720
Michel!

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.520
Weapons ready.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.920
Boot prints.

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.400
German made.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.040
Load.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:22.320
Michel, stop!

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.680
Booby trap.

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:45.680
Also German made.

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.720
The bunker must be very close.

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.280
Ready to fire.

01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:18.600
- What the hell?
- Paratroopers.

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:23.600
They probably sent us
because they didn't manage it.

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:26.000
Let's go.

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.480
Come on in. Come on!

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.040
Lieutenant.

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.960
We're looking for Colonel von Hardenburg.

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:36.000
Of course.

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:39.720
He's in the command bunker
and has been expecting you.

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.400
I'll take you to him.

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.920
But if you want to linger a while...

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:49.480
I'm certain...
that we can entertain you well enough.

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:53.240
Maria, get these gentlemen
wine and something to eat.

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:57.320
You look like you've had a long journey.

01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.120
To life!

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.080
Now take me to Colonel von Hardenburg.

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.240
Gladly, Lieutenant.

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:13.280
Well, then...

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:15.400
follow me.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:18.240
But just you.

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:28.640
Come along.

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.240
Don't be afraid.

01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.320
Lieutenant.

01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:21.680
New order via radio message.
Cover withdrawal of the last forces

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.680
on the Dnieper bridge
before it gets blown up.

01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:33.560
Quite a labyrinth.

01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:46.800
Be brave.

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.120
Paul.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.600
So the stories are true then.

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:43.440
Germany lost a lot in Stalingrad.

01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:46.840
What's one small hand in comparison?

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:50.360
Join me by the fire.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.080
Your lance corporal told me
that you were expecting someone.

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:01.320
No. I wasn't expecting someone.

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:02.880
I was expecting you.

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:08.560
Then you're sure to know
I'm here to bring you back.

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:11.880
Certainly.

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.520
You had to make this journey.

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:16.760
I was your best friend.

01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.640
Remember the summer
at the military academy in Hannover?

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:25.240
That warm August evening
when I introduced Marion to you?

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:30.600
<i>We went swimming the next day.</i>

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:35.040
Over to the little wooded island
in the middle of the lake.

01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:39.920
<i>It was a magical summer.</i>

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:43.840
The best summer ever.

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:46.920
After that there was only war.

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:49.800
We have to go.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.440
I assume you came in your Tiger.

01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.920
- Yes.
- It's cramped in there.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:05.240
Odd that they sent you in that
to pick us all up, don't you agree?

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.520
I'm sure they have their reasons.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:12.600
And if I refuse?

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.440
I want to avoid it coming to that.

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:29.360
But if it should come to that...

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:34.920
then they sent just the right man,
didn't they?

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.320
Orders are orders, after all.

01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:47.760
Come on, Philip. Eat with me.

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:51.240
A "last supper," so to speak.

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:55.960
We have no time for that.

01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:58.640
- We have to go.
- No time for an old friend?

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:02.240
I'm your son's godfather.
You have me to thank for your happiness.

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:05.400
Sit down.

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:31.120
When you've been buried under rubble
for five days

01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.400
and are slowly dying of thirst,

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:37.080
you have lots of time to think.

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.160
You see many things.

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:42.160
In the shadows.

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:45.800
I heard about your rescue.

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:49.440
Remarkable.

01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:56.360
What did we do in Stalingrad, Philip?

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:09.480
I don't have time for your games.

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:12.400
What did we do in Stalingrad?

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:27.800
Paul, these are orders.
They come straight from division.

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.640
Sir, the other commanders
are getting nervous.

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:34.720
Some say that the enemy has a fix on them.
They want to know what to do.

01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:37.960
Reports indicate women and children
sheltering inside.

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:42.040
But it's also full of Russian forces,
who control the factory,

01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:43.800
and with it this part of the city.

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:47.400
Our assault will fail if we don't act now.

01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.800
- Can you hear anything?
- No.

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:54.400
Paul...

01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:58.200
these are orders, it's not our decision.

01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:00.120
Is that so?

01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:03.240
The other commanders are waiting.

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.560
Paul!

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:20.720
Man your positions, men! Ready to engage!

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:28.040
Pass on the order.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.840
All other tanks, fire at will.

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:33.800
<i>All tanks, fire at will!</i>

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:45.360
Fire!

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.040
That wasn't our decision.

01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:30.520
We had no choice. We had orders.

01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.200
Yes, that may be.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
But we had the responsibility.

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:51.920
It's midnight.

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.120
You have to get back over the Dnieper.

01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:05.320
I'm here because of you.
We're all here because of you.

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.480
Don't you see that?

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.800
I'm here for Operation Labyrinth.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.480
Operation Labyrinth?

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:17.080
- That's you!
- <i>Philip!</i>

01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:18.520
I'm supposed to guide you out.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.520
I'm here because...

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:25.640
- Colonel Richter sent me here.
- Who might he be?

01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:29.760
Colonel Richter? Did he ever really exist?

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:37.720
Yes. The signs, they were there all along.

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:42.000
Keilig, what time have you got?

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:44.040
Nearly 12,
but it's stopped since the bridge.

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:49.440
- Bodies don't burn that fast.
- Something's not right here.

01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:52.320
You remember the flames, don't you?

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:57.600
Why didn't we burn to death on the bridge?

01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:58.640
<i>Please wake up!</i>

01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:04.040
But Krebs...

01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:07.040
- He...
- Maybe he was just a part of you.

01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:09.400
Like all of us.

01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:10.440
<i>Philip!</i>

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:12.520
It's midnight.

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:15.040
You have to get back over the Dnieper!

01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:16.680
<i>Philip! Give the order!</i>

01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:20.400
Why did you delay the order to retreat?

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:24.880
It's so unlike you
to put your crew and yourself in danger.

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:29.040
- Yes.
- Lieutenant?

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:38.200
Yes, it's been there all along.

01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:43.880
<i>The telegram informing you</i>

01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:47.960
that Marion and your son Fritz
died in Hamburg.

01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:52.480
<i>When the air raid began on July 24th,</i>

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:55.600
<i>they sought shelter
in the Church of St. Nicholas.</i>

01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:02.760
But when the bombs fell,
they died in the firestorm.

01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:12.360
<i>Fire!</i>

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.360
<i>Fire!</i>

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:20.880
I fought in this war to protect them.

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.600
We reap what we sow.

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.640
You led me here.

01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:37.440
Where is here?

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:49.000
What's going on?

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.680
Paul, what's going on here?

01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:55.000
What's going on here?

01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:00.440
We've reached the end of your journey.

01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.040
Mine ended back then.

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:07.200
That tractor factory, I never left it.

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:19.400
Come on, old friend.

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:22.360
It's time.

01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:33.120
I have to get to my men, Paul.

01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:36.280
They won't survive without me.

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:42.040
- Go, go, go!
- I'm on fire!

01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:43.560
Move!

01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:44.960
Helmut, go!

01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:47.160
I'm on fire!

01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:49.640
Go, go!

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:54.240
<i>Where am I, Paul?</i>

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:57.120
<i>Where am I?</i>
