Ahora, capitan?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.560
- Vamos a subirla!
- Si, senor.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.080
Despacio. Despacio.

No way!

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.040
Kirby. Kirby, I'm so sorry, darling.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
You got to get up.
I just got a phone call.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.560
I'm not supposed to tell you, but
there's this oil spill in Scotland.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.080
They need me. You've got to go to
your mum's. I know. I know.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.080
I'm so sorry. Will you get up?
Will you get up, please?

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.360
Love you, love you.
KIRBY GROANS

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.040
Thank you. Thank you.
I'll phone your mum.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.840
- Hello.
- Why have they activated you?
- I don't know.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.760
Uh, this is Kirby. They're my
child. They're with me.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.800
- But I'm in uniform.
- Yeah, we just
got to drop 'em off at their mum's.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.680
- It's in Fulham. It's on the way.
- We can get a taxi in two minutes.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.720
- I'm old enough.
I'm not a kid.
- No, look,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.800
you're not crossing London on your
own at this time of night

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.080
and that's that. I'm sorry, this is
just how it is. I'm sorry.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.360
So, why are you with soldiers?

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.560
Uh, well, because...

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.920
sometimes with an oil spill,
there might be, erm...arguments.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.080
- Thanks. Sorry about this.
- Can't be helped, I suppose.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.760
- You and that bloody job.
- Sorry, Mum.
- When are you back?

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.120
Oh, I can't tell. I'll text you.
LAUGHTER

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.440
Sorry to interrupt the party.
Who's there? Clive and Kalisha?

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.240
Yeah. And Stanley.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.160
Yeah. Well, he would be,
wouldn't he? See you.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.480
Sorry.
The ex is a bit cross with me.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.480
- You've broken so many rules.
- I know.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.480
And I want to say, um...

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.120
- I am sorry about Christmas.
- If you can't drink, don't.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.080
I checked.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.560
Apparently, you're onboard
to replace someone called

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.000
Roger Trevithick. He's on a mission
in Scotland,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.680
- so you've been made his replacement.
- Is that what it says?
- Yup.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.720
That thing about Roger Trevithick,
did that come from HR?

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.480
How should I know? General.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.240
Sergeant Chakri, welcome aboard.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.200
- And you are?
- Uh... Oh,
Barclay Pierre-Dupont, sir.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.400
- I'm Roger Trevithick's replacement.
- Oh, the civilian. Read and assess.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.360
I just wanted to say,
about Roger Trevithick,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.600
- did that come from HR...
- Barclay Pierre-Dupont,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.240
does that surname make you French?

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.840
- Uh, yeah, on my father's side.
- Tres bien.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.280
Oh, my God.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.600
- Barclay.
- Oh.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.040
- Hiya. Pip, innit?
- Yeah.
- I'm replacing Roger Trevithick.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.960
- Oh, my God. Yeah.
- OK.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.320
We arrive on Cabrera
at 09:00 local time.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.280
From there, we get taken
to the island of Dragonera.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.800
The village is called
Cala Escondida,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.720
designated prime location.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.000
There's a lot to take in,
so I suggest you make a start.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.200
AIRCRAFT WHIRS, SHUDDERS

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.320
Wow.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.720
GUNFIRE AND SCREAMING

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.360
Amazing, isn't it?

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.080
Mind blown.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.720
The thing about Roger Trevithick...

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.080
Look...

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.800
..I replaced him only one time,
back in 2020.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.160
His wife was having a baby,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.680
it was premature
and he had to rush off,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.800
and I just happened to be there.
So all I had to do

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.400
was answer his phone, which didn't
even ring, and so that was that.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.760
But then I went on file
as Roger Trevithick's replacement.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.800
- Ah. How is the baby?
- Yeah, the baby is fine.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.160
But t-t-the thing is,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.360
I-I just got stuck on the list in
HR. Roger Trevithick's replacement.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.280
I get, like, memos. I mean,
there's one time

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.040
I even got tickets to Japan,
and I'd email them.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.680
I'd say, "Look. Look, I'm not
Roger Trevithick's replacement."

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.520
- So?
- So I'm not Roger Trevithick's
replacement!

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.800
I'm grade ten.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.160
Ten?!

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.680
- You're ten?!
- Look, I...
- Don't talk to me!

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.360
- And I didn't show you anything.
- What, what do I do?!

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.080
I work in transport.
I just book the taxis!

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.040
RADIO CHATTER

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.000
All troops. As of now,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.240
the Mediterranean
is hostile territory.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.920
Village evacuated.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.080
Border established at 10km, sir.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.000
This entire coastline belongs to us.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.760
They hung it far away from the
village,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.080
like they were scared of it.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.280
Even in death.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.720
Decontamination
in progress.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.240
Decontamination in progress.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.280
Decontamination in progress.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.480
- Colonel.
- General.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.440
Quite a sight, isn't it?

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.960
Caught 5km off the coast.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.560
They shot it dead, but then thought
they could make money out of it.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.040
Hauled it up -

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.760
the monster from the deep.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.680
We saw it online.
Declared it a hoax.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.840
Flew in from Madrid,
sealed the place off,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.960
but it's quite a find.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.120
It's the first time we've seen one
exactly like this.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.680
In mythology and superstition
we call them sea devils,

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.160
but we're better than that now.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.360
Let's say, uh...

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.720
Homo Aqua.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.280
We think their species branched off
from temnospondyls,

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.200
which means the correct
name is Homospondyl Erectus.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.840
I say Homo Aqua because that's
what it looks like.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.920
- Do we have a sex?
- Difficult to say.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.280
The genitalia suggests
reptilian cloaca,

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.400
which is found on both male
and female.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.440
What about the neck?
Was there a pearl?

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.000
Plain and simple.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.800
Nothing artificial.
Calcium carbonate.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.040
60% aragonite,
40% calcite.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.920
Then I suggest we return it
to its rightful place.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.360
Every time we find a creature
like this, we find a pearl.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.680
It might be simple decoration.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.960
Mankind has worn pearls ever since
God knows when,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.040
but every pearl gets analysed

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.000
and we've found nothing.
No technology, no inscription,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.440
but still, it doesn't signify
a caste or belief or identity.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.960
The pearl is always located at

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.720
the base of the throat,
actually embedded in the skin.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.720
We think it's placed there at birth.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:45.160
It goes back at least 2,000 years,
sir, the use of pearls as jewellery.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.440
It's said Cleopatra
removed her pearl earring,

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.280
dissolved it in vinegar and drank it
in front of Mark Antony.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.440
Could be useful. File that.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.520
- Ready for the deep scan?
- Yes, sir.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.560
- Yes, sir.
- Corporal Morgan,

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.080
you can join the team here
and liaise with Sergeant Brock.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.280
Thank you, Miss Tso.
I think your team can stand down.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.680
- Yes, sir. Pack it up!
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Yes, Sergeant.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.520
Charge him up.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.200
- Coffee, sir.
- Thank you.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.160
Cheers.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.040
ELECTRICAL WHIRRING

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.760
I just wonder
what they're doing here.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.880
I mean, it's a pond,
the Mediterranean.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.480
It's got no depth.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.560
January 2020, there was
an avalanche underwater,

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.800
lasting two days, off the west coast
of Africa, spreading over 1,200km.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.120
Massive event.
All hidden under the sea.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.640
You think it was them?

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.400
It severed communications cables,
which I think is significant.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.440
You're waking up. Now, the world
is two thirds water.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.240
It's us against them.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.360
HIGH-PITCHED BOOM

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.240
BOOM VIBRATES

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.680
Well...

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.480
..I think they heard that.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.320
- What was that, sir?
- A translation pulse.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.680
We said hello.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.120
- Can we use our phones yet?
- No.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.080
No, no, no. It's a true story!
That's why people die.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.880
Most common domestic accident,

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.800
they fall down stairs,
break their necks.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.200
So what are you supposed to do?

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.200
Well, you go like this. As you fall,
you starfish, yeah?

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.680
It jams you into the stairwell,
you stop falling.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.040
But who is going to remember that?
You're falling!

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.600
You don't think, "What do I do?
What kind of fish?"

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.160
That's the point.
No-one remembers, so you die!

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.440
- LAUGHTER
- Anyway. Right, do you take sugar?

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.280
No, thanks.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.680
- Whoa! What the...
- What?
- What's all this?

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.240
- What's wrong? Muddy boots?
- Something's leaking. Bloody hell!

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.120
Careful! Is it chemicals?

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.480
Whoa! Right...

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.600
- What is it?
- I don't know.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.760
Wait... I don't know.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.560
What the hell?!

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.800
OK. No, no. Hold on to me.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.240
I can't.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.480
I can't!
SHE SCREAMS

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.120
Jesus! Right.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.240
We need help! We need help!

CREATURE SHRIEKS

ALARM BLARES

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.880
- What's happened?
- You have to decontaminate, sir.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.960
But tell me what's happening.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.560
I'm sorry, sir. You'll be able to
see once you...

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.040
Captain, tell me what's happened!

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.600
- They've gone, sir.
- What do you mean?
- Everything's gone.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.760
- Who was on duty?
- Corporal Morgan and Private Abdalla.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.240
Then, where are they?

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.440
- And where's that...thing?
- We were just seconds away,

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.800
they can't have got far.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.080
- Hold on! Keep the area clear.
- But they've stripped the place bare.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.320
Where did everything go?
Who was on duty?

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.920
Corporal Morgan. Private Abdalla.
Please report your location.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.120
We can search the village, sir.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.640
Corporal Morgan. Private Abdalla.
Please report.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.040
Corporal Morgan. Private Abdalla.

FAINT BUZZING

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.040
- Corporal Morgan.
- Corporal Morgan.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.320
- Private Abdallah.
- Private Abdallah.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.360
Please report your location.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.720
Please report

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.680
- Corporal Morgan?
- Corporal Morgan?

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.000
- Private Abdalla.
- Private Abdallah.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.440
What's that?

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.720
Huh?

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.080
What is that?

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.720
He was 28.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.720
I wanted to say sorry
you had to see that.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.320
- You got the wrong one.
- That was your first death.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.480
- I'm sorry.
- No. I'm here by mistake,
OK?

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.840
I haven't got clearance.
I am grade ten.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.720
I work in transport. I'm a clerk.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.400
You were meant to have
Roger Trevithick, right?

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.040
I've just ended up here by mistake.
I shouldn't be here.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.040
Are you saying you're here
by accident?

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.400
Yes, sir.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.640
And that, I suspect,
is how history is made.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.280
One great big chain of mistakes.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.800
But still, the UNIT protocol states,

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.120
at times of historical or
cultural or political impact,

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.440
a member of the civilian
staff must stand

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.760
alongside the military as witness.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.080
And they could not be more
civilian than you.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.080
Too late to turn back now, Barclay.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.520
Welcome aboard.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.880
Typical military intelligence.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.520
I got a First-Class degree
and did intensive training at

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.600
St Andrews for three years
to get here.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.680
You blundered in by mistake.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.440
Yeah.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.080
I'm the one who orders the cars and
finds cheaper lorries.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.440
But I met the Doctor once.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.760
No way.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.000
Last year in the tower,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.400
he said hello
and then he...then off he went.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.400
What was he like?

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.000
Just, like...

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.640
He was vivid, you know?

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.120
It was just this tiny
little moment, but...

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.440
..I think about it every
second of every day.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.480
That creature, what was it?

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:39.080
The Unified Intelligence Taskforce
was created to deal with

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.680
alien life forms, but...

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.360
..this species isn't alien.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.200
They're from Earth.
They were here before us.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.000
But...

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.600
What, did they die out? What...?

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.640
They hibernated, underground,

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.320
and this was when the Earth was
young cos the planet reformed around

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.160
them and sealed them in.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.400
Sometimes proof is
found and we hide it.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.360
What for?

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.720
Think about it.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.440
They were here first,
millions of years ago,

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.000
so the planet belongs to them.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.800
Technically,
we inherited their world,

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.880
but if they're not dead...

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.960
..what if they want it back?

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.040
Positive sighting! Grid 9!
We have a life form!

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.520
Let's go!

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.800
Barclay, with me!

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.160
Here, what's that? What's that?

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.240
- What's that for?
- You're the civilian
witness, you record everything.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.920
- That could be our testimony
if we get killed.
- If we get...

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.080
If we get what?!

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.720
At my command, arms down.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.160
All units, arms down.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.880
How are we on translation?

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.640
Aligned and running.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.680
Three, two, one...

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.360
Ready to calibrate, sir.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.000
As soon as it talks,
we can capture the sound.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.680
SCREECHES

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.480
Running translation, sir.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.160
We are calibrated, sir.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.560
Ready to go.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.400
My name is General Austin Pierce.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.880
RATTLING

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.920
..and I represent the
Unified Military Taskforce

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.760
of the Combined Nations
of the Drylands of Earth,

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.040
and I welcome you
into diplomatic concord.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.480
{\an8}Concord is a big concept.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.600
{\an8}Sorry, can we think of
another word, please?

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.640
Meeting.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.440
I welcome you into this
diplomatic...meeting.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.520
CREATURE SCREECHES

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.880
"You killed us."

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.960
Oh, God. Oh, no

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.920
You...then took two lives.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.200
And now...I suggest...we stop.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.680
CREATURE SCREECHES

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.840
"Agreed."

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.800
I hope we can meet in peace...

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.160
- "Agreed."
- ..and learn from each other...

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.160
"Agreed."

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:52.320
..and work to forge a friendship
between the land...and the sea.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.760
CREATURE SCREECHES

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.160
Is that agreed?

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.840
- "Agreed."
- Told ya.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.760
CREATURE SCREECHES

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.240
"But...

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.080
"..we do not...

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.000
"..agree."

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.960
Do not agree with...?

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.240
"We would talk to all your animals."

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.360
Humans.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.120
Er, "We would talk to all humanity."

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.280
Er, no, sorry, sir, it's...

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.920
..it's not "would" in the
conditional tense, sir,

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.480
it's, "We all talk. All. All of us."

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.640
Oh, my God...

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.080
I-It means all of them...

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.520
Repeat the declaration of peace.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.680
Yeah, I know.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.360
I say again...

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.040
..we come...in peace.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.480
"Agreed."
PIERCE SIGHS

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.800
No, no, no, hold on, sorry.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.720
We still haven't got
the right translation.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.760
{\an8}"We all talk" is a
layered statement,

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.200
{\an8}there's another concept embedded.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.680
{\an8}Could he say it again, please?

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.440
{\an8}Don't refer to them as male.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.920
I ask you to repeat
your previous statement...

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.760
..for translation.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.440
CREATURE SCREECHES

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.520
"We are talking to the whole world."

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.080
"We are talking to the
whole world...right now."

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.520
Present tense.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.160
What do they mean? In-In...
In what way?

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.000
BEEPING

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.080
It's happening all over the world.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.400
All over the world, humanity
reacts to the simple fact -

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.400
the species that came
before us has woken up.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.280
HE SPEAKS CHINESE

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.520
..and the President has called
for a new age of cooperation.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.080
It's being called H2O Diplomacy.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.200
The first official meeting with
Homo Aqua will begin here,

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.560
on the banks of the Thames,
inside Imperial House.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:49.000
Behind me, that's the construction
that's being called the Waterway.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.200
It's a specific demand
from Homo Aqua as a junction

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.240
between the water and the land.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.320
Some say it's a symbol of peace.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.680
OK, so I can't do
the 17th or the 24th

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.000
and I don't know yet about the 31st.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.560
Bloody hell! You can't do that!

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.520
That job of yours is useless.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.800
- Kirby!
- What?

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.120
Your dad said he can't come

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.360
and get you for the next three
weekends because he's not bothered.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.840
Is that a problem, Kirby?

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.160
No.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.840
What about me? I've got plans

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.080
Yeah? So, anyway, I have just
put 3,000 quid in your account.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.160
- Hope that's OK.
- What do you mean?

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.240
Like I said.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.240
You did not. Where's that from?

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.080
Well, I got promoted, thank you,
but apparently my job's useless.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.400
Well, if I'm getting £3,000,
how much did you get?

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.960
- Oh, that's nice.
- Mm-hm.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.640
Well, you can get some extra cooks
in now, help with the business.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.880
- Thank you.
- Funny thing is,
with these Sea Devils,

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.520
it's got Kirby watching proper
TV again, like the old days.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.320
Well, you can't
say Sea Devils.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.920
They're called homospondyls.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.840
All right, don't laugh.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.160
Don't laugh because
"homo" doesn't mean "gay".

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.280
It does if you're my age.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.120
So Homo Aqua's Gay Water.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.920
That's them, the Gay Waters!

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.920
That's what you've been drinking,
Kirby - too much gay water.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.160
Shut up!

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.400
So, what's this promotion, then?
What are you doing?

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.480
Er, it's just, you know...
just more admin.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.920
Come on, this way.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.360
General Austin Pierce in Grid B2,
Seat 1. Morning, everyone.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.760
A very good morning to you,
General Pierce, and to everyone.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.520
For the record and for history,
my name is Kate Lethbridge-Stewart,

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.520
Commander-in-Chief of the
Unified Intelligence Taskforce.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.040
UNIT has been chosen to lead these
talks because we stand above

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:50.320
and outside all countries, borders,
governments and oceans of the world.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.480
We represent humanity.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.440
But today, we represent
all life on Earth.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.600
And I hope this will be the start
of a great endeavour to find peace

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.800
between all of our kindred species.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.280
To begin the formal proceedings,
confirm Downing Street online.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.360
Good morning, Prime Minister.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.040
Good morning, Kate.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.400
Extraordinary days.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.960
I spent a long time working
hard to get the people's vote,

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.200
now we've got new people.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.640
White House online.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.920
Confirmed.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.520
Hall of the People, Beijing.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.600
Confirmed.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.360
National Congress of Brazil.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.920
Confirmed.
We have all 195 nations, ma'am.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.440
And do we have the Ambassador?

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.400
Approaching now.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.280
Apparently, he had the
lobster thermidor last night,

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.880
against our advice.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.120
Let's hope that's not a
major crime down below.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.320
Thank you, Mrs Bingham.
Let's concentrate, eyes on the task.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.760
Pardon me, ma'am.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.560
Ah, General.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.320
Good to see you, sir.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.840
Very special day.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.120
- Absolutely.
- Hmm.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.160
Mr St Lewis, how's the Waterway?
Are we ready to go?

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.000
Stress is holding.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.760
Seals checked and secure.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.240
A16 has been fixed.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.160
The only way to see if
this works is to do it.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.440
You've got quite a crowd.

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.600
All under control.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.560
Ma'am, we have a press drone.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.360
Ready for that. Take them out.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.880
GASPING

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.840
What was that?

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.920
- Paparazzi drone.
- Did they see us?

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.760
One-way glass.
Didn't you read anything?

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.800
My family don't know where
I am, they'd flip!

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.040
Thanks to you, I'm not
even allowed in this room!

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.280
Very well done!

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.720
I...

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.280
That's Roger Trevithick.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.640
Prepare tank activation.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.760
Positions, and good luck to us all.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.880
To confirm, the
perimeter's now secure, ma'am.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.680
- All stations at Gold Standard.
- Thank
you, if you could not interrupt.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.320
We have all comms focused
and recording, backups online.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.480
Good, good.
Mrs Bingham, let's begin.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.960
Initiate tank activation.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.560
And flood the tank.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.880
Open seals one, two, three.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.760
Open seals four, five.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.320
Take it up to 100 PSI.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.280
Open seals six, seven, eight.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.120
SHOUTING

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.880
- Section 45 compromised.
- System compromised.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.360
Emergency teams.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.440
Void stable.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.760
Water filtered and purity at 98%.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.560
940,000 litres.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.440
Well done, Mrs Bingham.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.280
Thank you, ma'am.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.320
Now, are we ready?

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.720
Let's welcome our guests.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.200
Open water lock one.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.680
Looks like we have six life forms.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.600
And a seventh.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.960
Four Homospondyl Erectus,
AKA Homo Aqua.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.320
Two of an unknown life form.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.960
One of a second unknown.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.080
Three different life forms in total.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.240
General Pierce to all troops,
red status.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:34.440
Confirm... Red status.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.600
And here they come.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.800
Two unknown life forms entering.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.760
It's just...

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.360
What are we saying?

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.120
I'd call them Piscimorpha Grandis.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.920
Welcome to Piscimorpha Grandis.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.840
- Does that mean "Big Fish"?
- Yup.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.200
Focus, thank you.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.280
That's the signal for the airlock.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.920
Third life form approaching.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.440
Ma'am, we don't know what
that third life form is.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.000
Then the first gambit is
to trust them, Colonel.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.080
Open the doors.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.360
Activating airlock pumps.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.680
Airlock at full capacity.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.040
Decontamination in progress.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.160
MURMURING

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.280
I'd say Homomorpha Sapiens...

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.000
..or, to simplify, Homo Amphibian.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.680
Oh, amazing.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.880
They killed two of us, remember?

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.480
We killed them.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.880
That's what this is for -
to bring peace.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.240
Ready with translations?

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.640
Up and running, ready to go.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.880
Sir Jonathan, good luck.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.960
HE CLEARS THROAT

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:52.080
I, er, I bid you welcome on
behalf of the human race.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.200
DEVICE CLICKS

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.120
I stand here as, er...

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.640
We do not need translation.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.640
Did we learn their language?

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.680
No, we did not.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.720
Save the comments.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.040
Well, your...
your English is excellent.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.200
SPEAKS RUSSIAN

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.880
That's...Russian.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.240
HE SPEAKS RUSSIAN

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.480
Well played, old man.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.880
I bring you greetings from the
United Nations of this world

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.360
that we call Earth.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.160
It's a symbolic title
of Indo-European origin

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:34.760
that bears no disrespect
to the oceans, seas, lakes,

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.920
rivers and waterways around us.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.200
And I bring you a gift.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.720
Rhododendron nivale,
the dwarf snow rhododendron.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.000
A flower that grows at the
highest point on planet Earth,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.800
on the slopes of Mount Everest,
four miles above sea level,

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.120
perhaps never seen by your kind.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.000
Now, it carries a scent, erm...

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.960
..or a flavour, an essence that
you will have never known before.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.360
Would you, erm...?

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.520
THEY INHALE

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:21.480
This is given with respect and the
hope of peace between our species.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.880
We have a gift for you.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.280
My children.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.800
GASPING

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.800
MURMURING

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:45.160
My children should have been born at
the turn of the Third Cold Current.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.320
But they choked on your oil.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.360
And poison.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.720
And excrement.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.760
Skip to 16!

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.200
Sir Jonathan, go to 16,
paragraph 10.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.080
I must state with vigour
that we recognise the problem.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.000
Our solutions are remarkable...

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.080
We do not know you.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.640
Well, I...

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.280
I am Ambassador...
Sir Jonathan Hynes...

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.840
You are not known to us.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.040
We would speak...

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.360
..with him.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.200
Me?!

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.040
Who the hell is he?

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.680
Well, he's...nothing. He's no-one.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.720
He... He's part of the team,
he's the witness.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.320
He's the mistake.
He was there by mistake!

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.880
Give me intel on him, now!

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.040
- Yes, ma'am.
- Right away, ma'am.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.800
No! Sorry.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.240
No, no.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.480
Y-Y-Y-You...
You've got the wrong man.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.120
You showed respect.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.880
Er...

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.040
No, that's just a...
that's just a thing.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.880
You respected our fallen
kin when no others did.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.680
What are they, Christians now?!

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.720
Someone tell me what's going on!

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.880
I'm not even religious.
I don't know why I did it...

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.160
But we saw your kindness.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.800
And we see you.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.080
Will you stand as Ambassador?

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.240
And talk on behalf of
the entire human race?

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.320
OK.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.040
