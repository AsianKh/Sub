WEBVTT

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.600
All over the world, humanity
reacts to the simple fact

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.480
the species that came
before us has woken up.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.560
We would speak...

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.800
..with him.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.920
We're putting an enormous
amount of pressure on one man.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.720
Tissue samples.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.120
"Know thine enemy."

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.200
It'll be the death of the energy
industry, of your livelihood.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.720
We'll be sliding into recession.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.080
We cannot hear, or see, or breathe,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.400
so tell me why we should live
like this for just one day longer.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.080
- Mum!
- Oh, my God!

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.120
They're cleaning up the ocean.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.960
The plastic, the pollution -
all of it, they're giving it back.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.920
All across Manhattan,
the sky is raining plastic.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.440
They're declaring war.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.320
Our next meeting will be here.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.240
Romanche Trench, one of the
deepest waterways on the planet.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.360
Will you meet us, Barclay,
at the bottom of the ocean?

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.400
OK.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.120
Let's go, people.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.880
Welcome to Blackport.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.120
{\an8}We don't have much time,
but we've appointed the best

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.840
{\an8}naval training personnel to
prep us for the descent.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.200
They'll be doing everything
they can to prime us,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.040
both physically and mentally...

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.480
..monitor our stamina,
heart rate and blood pressure...

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.320
..and help get us used to the water.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.800
We'll be descending to the
rendezvous point in this

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.960
submersible, to a depth of
8,000m, five miles down.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.400
Our journey will take
2 hours and 17 minutes.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.440
The submersible is currently on a
launch vessel with warship escorts,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.920
bound for the descent point.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.040
On the dive will be the Ambassador,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.680
myself, Captain Mackie
for communication,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.520
Ms Tso for science and technology,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.480
and our two diplomatic
representatives, Mr Singh...

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.640
Oh. Ravi.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.800
..and Mr Campbell.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.040
Ted. It's a pleasure.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.960
Have we ever been this deep before?

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.360
Smaller missions of
one or two people.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.840
Nothing of this scale.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.560
And I bet they were
trained specialists

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.000
with years of experience.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.560
We have days to prepare for this.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.960
Yeah, of course there's a risk.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.800
What we're doing today
is unprecedented,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.200
but this is the toughest
submersible on the planet.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.080
This is Kate Lethbridge-Stewart
to launch vessel.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.720
Captain Gaitz, how are we doing?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.880
Just finishing final checks.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.800
MAN BARKS INSTRUCTIONS

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.720
Pre-launch checks complete.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.160
Submersible ready for deployment.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.960
Things go wrong all the time.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.560
What if it springs a leak?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.560
That kind of pressure,
you'll be crushed to death,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.760
pulverised in an instant.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.800
Oh, just keep your
voice down, will you?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.320
If you do this,
you might never come back.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.200
Deep sea pressure compresses
air-filled spaces in the body,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.480
leading to lung compression
and potential collapse...

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.680
Now, once we arrive
at the descent point,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.520
Homo Aqua will transfer
us to their environment.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.960
Well, what about the descent?
Are they helping us with that?

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.240
For the descent, we're on our own.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.560
We're not alone. We're never alone.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.040
Sorry?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.160
We're a team.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.600
- OK.
- Yeah.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.480
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.520
Transfer by helicopter is at 0600.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.000
Indemnity forms need signing,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.880
and legal have noted you haven't
replied to their emails.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.040
You do need to make sure
your will is up to date.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.000
What he lacks in
experience and expertise,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.760
Dupont appeared to
make up for in passion.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.920
His unconventional
communication style

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.040
in such crucial peace
negotiations...

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.160
So, this is it, then.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.320
..seems to have convinced the
Aquakind Ambassador...

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.480
- Do I get a hug before I go?
- ..but questions remain...

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.880
It might take weeks
to clean the roads.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.280
The city's been shut down.
You can't go anywhere.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.200
Yeah, well, it's lucky you're
back here, then, isn't it?

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.560
We're at war.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.560
I know. I'm going to sort it.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.640
How?!

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.760
How are you going to sort anything?

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.640
Do you know what they're
calling you on TikTok?

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.960
- Oh, I don't really care...
- They're saying you're useless.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.960
Traitor. Boot-licker.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.360
Bleeding-heart puppet,
too thick to negotiate.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.480
- That's not fair!
- It doesn't matter
cos either way, we're screwed!

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.120
Either...wither they kill
us or we kill ourselves!

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.720
I hate the lot of you!

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.000
DOOR SLAMS

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.360
They're worried sick about you.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.400
Yeah, I know.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.760
I'm sorry, but I promise you,
I'm going to be fine.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.920
No, no, no, no, no, please, please.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.480
Please, don't.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.000
I've got this, OK? I can do this.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.160
I mean, for God's sake, I nursed
Mum through cancer, didn't I?

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.960
Didn't I? Bloody hell,
if I can get through that,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.720
oh, I can get through
anything, can't I?

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.160
I've got to be strong
for everyone else, right?

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.840
Cos everyone's counting on me.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.120
Kate, Salt and Kirby...

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.520
The whole world!

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.360
You don't have to be strong for me.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.760
Barbara...

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.480
Barbara, I'm so scared!

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.720
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.200
THEY CRY

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.120
Right, that's it. OK, now.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.720
You all right? Yeah?

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.920
Yeah, sorry.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.400
- Ravi?
- Hm?
- Are you OK?

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.760
Mm-mm.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.760
I've been a diplomat
for three months!

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.760
Three months! I'm...
I'm not cut out for this.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.120
Of course you are.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.800
You're going to come back a hero.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.480
You know that, right?

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.320
This'll set us up for life.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.160
Speaking tours, book deals -
the works.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.960
Do you think I'll get
a girlfriend out of it?

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.840
They're going to be
queuing up, mate!

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.880
All you've got to do
is hang in there.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.560
You know, sometimes I can hear my
life coach. "Hold the line, Ted."

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.440
That's what he'd say
in moments like these,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.760
moments of fear, of self-doubt.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.480
"Believe in yourself,
trust in fate and hold the line."

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.400
Guy got struck by lightning.
Dead at 50.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.720
Seriously?!

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.720
HE LAUGHS

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.840
What's in the box?

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.080
Diplomatic gift...

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.440
..from all nations.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.200
And what are Homo Aqua
supposed to do with a globe?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.040
They see the world from
underneath, right? From the depths.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.200
Never like this.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.800
Where are they going to put it, Ted?

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.440
Who knows? Maybe they've got,
like, coral mantlepieces.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.160
Aren't you fazed by any of this?

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.000
We're going to be fine. Wood floats.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.320
In the words of a great man...

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.320
.."We can be heroes."

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.360
Let's save the world.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.560
Seal the hatch.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.040
Control to all units.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.440
We are clear.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.880
Confirm lock.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.200
Captain Gaitz, handing
control over to you.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.600
OK, let's pick it up.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.920
Let's move it out.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.280
Taking you off the ship now.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.440
Good luck, everybody.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.640
Good luck to you all.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.680
Vessel looking stable, sir. Over.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.400
Deployment is go.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.960
Control to deck.
All readings are stable.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.600
We are good to go. Over.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.480
Are you OK, Ted?

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.920
Oh, yeah, terrific. Yep.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.400
Gently...

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.760
Prepare for release.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.360
- This is it.
- Mm.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.680
On my mark...

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.520
In three...

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.160
..two...

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.000
..one.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.040
Mark.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.280
THEY BREATHE SHAKILY

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.400
And we're off.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.120
HEAVY BREATHING

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.440
How long's it been?

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.640
- Seven minutes.
- Oh...

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.560
Gone dark already. No sunlight.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.080
Imagine living like
this all the time.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.920
Anyway, we're fine, aren't we?

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.720
Can I get a "Yes, Ted"?

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.400
Yes, Ted.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.680
I've got some team-bonding
word games if anyone's interested.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.120
No, thank you.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.240
How did you end up here anyway?

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.040
Oh...

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.680
There was a diplomatic lottery
for the two last seats and...

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.720
..India won.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.400
Or lost, depending
on how you see it.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.400
LOUD CLATTER, RAVI GASPS

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.120
There was rumours flying around
that the draw was rigged,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.880
that most people had their names
removed cos they didn't want to go.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.840
I mean, one way to look
at it is we're pioneers,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.240
like those early astronauts.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.880
You know, where would we be if they
hadn't taken that "one giant leap"?

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.040
LOUD CLATTER

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.600
THEY EXCLAIM

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.840
What the hell is that?!

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.840
It's adjusting to the pressure.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.120
Are you sure?

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.000
It's OK, Ted. Just breathe.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.240
Oh, I'm-I'm breathing. I'm-I'm fine.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.880
HE EXHALES

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.560
What do you think
we'll get for dinner

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.400
when we're back on the
ship tonight, hmm?

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.440
Think they'll spoil us?

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.480
They bloody should!

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.760
No, it'll just be canteen
sandwiches again.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.000
It's tough being a hero!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.520
LAUGHTER

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.440
Is this...? Is this water?

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.320
This...this is water!
There is water in here!

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.400
- Ted...
- Radio the ship!

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.680
Ted, calm down. It's condensation.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.120
How the hell do you know?!

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.480
Because I read page six
of the safety briefing!

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.720
Yeah. Sorry. I...

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.080
I guess if there was a breach,

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.800
this thing would implode
before we knew about it, so...

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.720
Can everyone just
shut up now, please?

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.200
LOUD CLATTER

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.720
The economy's already tanking.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.480
If we start closing shipping lanes,
the effect could be catastrophic.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.120
- Hello.
- Sorry, sir.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.720
Kate Lethbridge-Stewart.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.760
OK.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.680
It is a directive of
the United Nations

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.320
that Unit have a voice in
any emergency discussions.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.160
Sorry, we started a little early.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.040
A lot of people couldn't make it.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.200
Some of the Cabinet
are joining remotely.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.960
With respect, it's a phone call.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.760
I'll catch up. Please, carry on.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.360
HE CLEARS THROAT

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.760
The United States relies on maritime
trade and we will defend ourselves

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.440
vigorously against any
disruption to our networks.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.160
The US military is arming
itself with sonic weaponry.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.520
Sound cannons are used
for crowd control,

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.440
but we've adapted the
technology for underwater use.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.840
We've identified key shipping
lanes we need to protect -

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.000
the English Channel,
the Panama Canal, the Suez.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.480
Ultra-high frequency blasts could
disable or confuse Homo Aqua,

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.200
paving the way for
traditional weapons...if required.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.920
Sorry, why are we discussing
weapons? Our focus is on diplomacy.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.320
And there is an armistice
agreement in place now

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.920
to stop further violence.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.840
Someone's got to be the
first to break it.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.680
Sir, our focus should
be on diplomacy.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.320
That's why six of our diplomats
are risking their lives today.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.360
They're buying time,
that's all they're doing.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.720
It's song and dance,
smoke and mirrors.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.920
The General's right.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.160
We make decisions,
here, in this room.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.960
The Western Front,
the Falklands, Iraq.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.120
Wars are fought
and won at this table.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.000
They think they own the water,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.880
but while they were splish-splashing
around 300 million years ago,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.800
we crawled out of the water...

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.760
..then we conquered it.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:26.280
We built a civilisation that depends
on our oceans to power our homes,

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.520
feed our crops and keep us alive.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.040
And keep you in business.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.960
Sorry, but I agree with Kate.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.200
Their civilisation is so ancient
and so powerful, aren't they a gift?

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:41.000
Couldn't they help solve not just
the climate crisis but so much more

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.800
IF we had them onside?

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.680
We're never going to get them
onside! They want us gone!

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.240
If they wanted us gone, I think
that would've already happened.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.920
If they were gone, we could have
access to their technology.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.200
Think of it - treasure
from the ocean floor.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.880
This is a diplomatic crisis,
not a pirate raid.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.360
That's what the West does best -
colonise and plunder.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.360
I'm sorry, but...

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.880
..I'm 60% water.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.920
We all are.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.040
Don't tell me we
don't own the water.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.680
If Homo Aqua want a war
between the land and the sea,

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.720
we'll take the sea.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.040
Sir, this kind of rhetoric
is irresponsible.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.760
If you're trying to keep the peace,
you've already failed.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.040
If you're not onside, we might
have to reconsider our options.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.640
Diplomatic responsibility
can easily be transferred.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.120
What, to you?

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.120
A global emergency committee
could guide Homo Aqua through

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.680
- a peace process that puts
mankind first...
- Sorry.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.800
- ..not Unit.
- ..but what is Sir Keith
doing in an emergency meeting?

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.960
He-He's not Cabinet or Agency,

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.920
and his companies,
at this very moment,

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.400
are still pumping millions of litres
of sewage into our waterways.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.640
These processes take time.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.840
And don't get me started
on General Dussolier,

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.120
who leaked confidential
information to the press!

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.480
I think you need to calm down, love.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.320
This is a national security matter!

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.680
The fact is we need industry
and our allies onside.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.240
We can't do this alone.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.640
What's going to happen down there?

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.760
Ravi, come on.
We've already said, we don't know.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.600
So, what if this is a trick
and they want hostages?

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.960
We didn't take any hostages -
why should they?

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.680
Cos that's what happens in war.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.440
Look, I promise you,
we're going to sort this, OK?

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.280
I don't know how we will,
but we will,

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.520
cos my kid is not
living through a war.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.880
I never had kids,
but if I get out of here,

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.400
I'm going to call my brother.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.560
We haven't spoken for 20 years.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.920
Good for you.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.560
First thing I'm doing is
taking my family out for a meal.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.760
All 19 of us.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.240
19?!

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.400
Yeah!

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.000
Yeah, and I'm paying.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.400
LOUD CLATTER

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.240
Oh, it's so hot.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.200
This suit...

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.200
How deep are we?

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.480
All right, Ted, come on. Come on,
Ted, don't think about that.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.960
I watched this show where they
made a human out of pig parts -

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.000
bones and meat - and they put it
in a diving suit, and-and they...

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.080
..they tested it for
deep-sea pressure, and it...

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.600
- Mr Campbell!
- ..and it just turned
to soup in a split second.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.560
OK, Ted, Ted, no-one
wants to hear this.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.920
And I don't want to be soup!

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.240
TED SOBS

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.200
All right, OK. It's OK, you're OK.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.640
Ted, come on! Come on!
Look at me. Just breathe.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.240
Just breathe now.
Breathe now, please, with me, OK?

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.280
Slow and steady, with me -
cos we're a team, aren't we?

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.560
Yeah? OK.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.640
THEY BREATHE SLOWLY

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.960
OK?

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.680
Thank you.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.800
CLATTERING

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.880
Well, all six delegates should now
be descending to the ocean floor.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.000
Meanwhile, emergency crews
continue to clear arterial roads

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.360
- through major cities...
- Can you turn that off, please?

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.600
..while the national curfew remains
in place for at least 12...

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.840
A few days ago, the
situation was dire.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.240
We were staring down the
barrel of unprecedented

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.080
financial and energy crises.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.320
Now it's catastrophic.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.400
We cannot surrender
control of this planet.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.200
Look what they did
to us in 15 minutes.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.360
If they wanted to,
they could wipe us out.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.480
Unit are looking after
their own interests.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.280
It is our moral duty to stop
Aquakind, however we can.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.880
Harry, I know you have a
lot on your plate right now.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.320
Alison has tests today.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.920
I should be with her.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.080
I already know you value my opinion.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.600
And maybe my money.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.520
The Generals have decades of
military strategy under their belts.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.760
Let us guide you,
take the pressure off.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.960
When I became Prime Minister,
I made a promise to my grandchildren

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.680
to leave this country
better than I found it.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.800
Sir, if we don't win this war -

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.400
and war is what it is...

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.640
..there will be no grandchildren.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.000
But we believe there is
a way through this.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.800
A new stratagem, just between us.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.360
We're calling it Severance.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.280
I found some instant coffee.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.040
And...

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.640
..biscuits.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.840
I won't ask you what you
had to do for those.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.520
Ha! Yeah, best not.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.880
HE SIGHS

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.920
They'll be OK.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.960
But you look exhausted.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.760
Well, I've had six hours' sleep
in three days.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.680
This morning, I showered in a sink,

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.880
sent good people five
miles under the ocean,

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.760
then sat through a Cobra meeting
with a room full of warmongers.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.960
You need a break.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.520
They want to shut Unit out.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.840
And if we lose control,
who steps in?

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.920
Who decides the future
of the human race?

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.320
Sorry, the submersible's entering
the deepest part of the trench.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.360
Yeah.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.640
Get me Captain Gaitz, I want
a situation report ASAP.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.400
This is uncharted territory.
They're off the maps now.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.360
This'll be the longest
night of our lives.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.760
THEY BREATHE HEAVILY

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.000
LOUD CLATTER, THEY EXCLAIM

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.720
What's that? What's happened?!

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.880
I think we've stopped.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.560
Are we...? Are we on the seabed?

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.080
Negative.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.040
This is SU-1 to surface.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.520
Surface, this is SU-1.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.840
Hello?

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.480
Is anyone there?

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.400
Oh, my God...

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.240
LOUD CLATTER

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.400
We're moving again.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.720
ALARM WAILS

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.320
Captain, what's happening?!

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.000
We're moving at 12 knots.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.040
18 knots.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.960
These readings don't make sense.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.320
That's not possible!

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.280
30 knots! Something's taken control!

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.200
How are they moving so fast?

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.920
Captain!

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.480
What...? Are they being dragged?

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.720
Mm, think so.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.320
They're descending twice as fast.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.720
Steve, how's the pressure?

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.560
Pressure is holding.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.680
We've lost comms.
Ping the transponder!

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.920
No response.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.960
OK, do you feel that? Do you
feel like we're descending again?

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.520
Why is there no radio contact?

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.000
- I don't know.
- Oxygen's normal.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.120
The cables are functioning.
We're just...

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.160
Cut off...

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.280
..on our own.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.120
- LOUD RUMBLE, RAVI EXCLAIMS
- What's happening?!

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.480
ALARM SOUNDS

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.840
ALARM STOPS

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.200
LOUD RUMBLE, THEY YELP

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.480
We've stopped.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.040
And the pressure on
the hull is 1,200hPa.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.280
What, is that...is that good or bad?

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.240
Well, that's like sea level.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.480
That's the pressure on land,
except we're five miles down.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.040
Five miles!

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.760
So, what, are we inside something?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.160
LOUD RUMBLE

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.960
- RAVI YELLS
- The whole system's gone down!

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.600
- Oh, my God...!
- Helmets on, everyone.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.320
Backup should kick in any second.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.240
This is a trap!
They're going to kill us!

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.680
For Christ's sake, Ted! Shut up!

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.160
Oh, that's it? That's backup?!

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.440
There's something at the hatch.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.720
It's them!

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.640
They're breaking in!

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.840
Brace positions!

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.400
Who's going first?

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.680
- Yeah...
- Is it a cave?

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.360
I don't know. Wait there.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.760
Oh!

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.960
Ah, bloody hell.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.480
It's alive.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:49.960
Temperature's 21 degrees Celsius,
which is...impossible.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.600
The atmosphere's breathable.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.440
Not just breathable, it's perfect.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.640
This place is incredible.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.920
You can come out now.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.920
Be careful, there's a drop.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.360
It's some kind of membrane.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.920
There's got to be billions of
tonnes of water behind this.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.320
RUMBLING

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.120
One tear in that membrane...

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.360
Watch your step,
the ground's uneven.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.440
If this is the ground.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.400
LOUD WHOOSH

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.440
Ah...!

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.320
What the hell was that?

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.520
- Decontamination?
- Everyone OK?

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.000
- OK?
- What is this place?

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.320
It's like...

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.680
..nothing in the world.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.120
It's like hell.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.000
Welcome.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.240
Where exactly are we?

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.360
Deeper than any human has ever been.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.120
You can remove your apparatus.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.640
No, wait.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.160
This environment has
been prepared for you.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.080
Will you trust me, Barclay?

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.920
Yeah.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.360
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.960
It's OK.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.760
DRIPPING

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.240
The roof's leaking!

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.680
There is no roof.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.440
What??

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.480
But you are safe.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.600
Er...

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.680
Yeah, I'd prefer to keep this on.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.520
As you wish.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.920
It's fatigue.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.720
You're running on empty.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.760
All this pressure,
it's taking its toll.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.640
Pretty soon, you're going
to be of no use to anyone.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.760
I feel fine.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.400
After 48 hours, the brain
and the body start to shut down.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.200
I've seen it happen, and I'm
watching it happen to you.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.880
If I reported you,
you'd be escorted from the building.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.200
Except you wouldn't do that.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.160
The delegates are miles beneath the
surface in radio silence for hours.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.800
There's nothing else
you can do right now.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.440
But soon as they're back,
we need you on form,

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.760
rested and ready for
whatever comes next.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.200
You're amazing.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.000
But you're not invincible.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.680
Either I take you home to rest
or I report you.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.480
My apartment is a fully-equipped
comms hub. I'll work from there.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.440
So, how is it light down here?

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.240
Well, many deep-sea
organisms are bioluminescent -

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.640
bacteria, plankton, species of fish.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.400
So, are we, er...

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.760
..inside an organism or...?

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.040
I have no idea.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.440
This is impossible!

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.400
Your world of steel and glass

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.000
and sunlight is equally
impossible to us.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.920
And is this...
is this is where you live?

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.560
No.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.600
We are nomads.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.200
All of the oceans and
waterways are our home.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.280
They are curious, that is all.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.440
So, d-d-do you all
live here together?

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.040
Like, all the species?

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.160
There are the fish...

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.280
..there are the titans...

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.400
..the dolphins...

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.360
..and us.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.880
Ah, so it's, er...
it's like a hierarchy, then?

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.920
Like a class system?

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.040
There are degrees of intellect.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.480
Do not assume we think as one.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.880
Oh! Oh, so...

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.480
Sorry, sorry.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.880
I...

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.920
I just, er...

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.200
This is a lot, and...

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.160
Here, hold on to me.

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.760
Come on, come on.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.800
Keep moving, keep moving.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.840
Come on.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.600
Hang on, where are the others?

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.560
Have the walls moved?

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.400
It's just you...

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.720
..and me.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.080
I feel like I know you...

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.800
..or I'm going to know you...

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.160
..or I've known you forever.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.640
Is that weird?

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.600
I understand.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.880
You're so warm.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.200
And rough.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.360
Can I, erm...?

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.680
Can I touch you?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.280
What do you feel?

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.680
Strength...

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.240
..and beauty.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.400
I don't know why you chose me...

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.440
..for any of this.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.480
The tides have drawn us together.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.760
The undercurrents pulling us closer.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.640
If you calm your mind...

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.480
..you'll feel their power.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.360
But your thoughts are noisy.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.640
Can you read them?

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:23.040
Human emotions are so loud,
we cannot help but listen.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.120
Your heart is racing.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.080
Yeah, I don't want to mess this up.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.440
Billions of people
are counting on us.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.440
You have good intentions.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.200
We could make a difference,
you and I.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.800
End the conflict
between our species...

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.280
..before it's too late.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.160
Yeah.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.760
Barclay!

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.560
We thought we'd lost you.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.440
Are you all right?

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.520
Yeah.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.120
We are assembled.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.000
Oh, my God!

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.400
Do not be afraid.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.080
This is how it felt for you,
meeting us.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.920
Welcome...to our domain.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.640
They're down there, on their own...

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.520
..with no support.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.800
Do you think, one day, we won't
need to keep us a secret any more?

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.200
I don't know.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.120
I'm sick of hiding it,

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.600
pretending,

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.240
worrying about being transferred
to God-knows-where.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.440
Alaska?

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.120
HE SCOFFS

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.600
You find it so easy.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.440
The future of the human race
pivots on what happens tonight.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.840
We don't matter.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.280
How can you be thinking about us?

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.720
I think about us all the time.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.240
Can't you not be commander-in-chief,
just for a few hours?

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.520
I don't know how.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.160
PHONE RINGS

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.320
Leave it.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.840
Shirley, hi.
Any news from the delegates?

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.600
No, all quiet.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.320
So, I ran some intel on the
people in that Cobra meeting.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.400
Thanks.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.920
I think I found something -

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.360
a repeated word in
diplomatic communications.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.160
Does the word Severance
mean anything to you?

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.200
No.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.440
It's never appeared before,

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.560
now it's been used 14 times
in the last two days.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.720
Coded messages going back and forth.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.960
"Severance," "Severance,"
"Severance..."

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.400
GUNSHOT

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.520
Kate?

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.560
Kate, are you there?

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.960
Kate?

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.240
Kate? Kate?

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:36.760
Kate, are you there?!

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.040
Kate!

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.760
This is for you.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.040
All right, you breathe.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.320
You keep breathing.

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.040
All right?

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.520
All right.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.640
I'm going to get help.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.320
Darling, stay with me.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.080
Please, don't go!

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.280
Please, don't leave me!

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.760
Don't...leave!

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.160
I love you!

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.880
Your war...

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.880
..is...lost.
