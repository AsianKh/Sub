00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.160
Hallo?

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:33.385
NO CHILDREN PAST THIS POINT

00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:52.446
You can do it, Jimmy.

00:01:53.531 --> 00:01:55.699
Old Nick likes you raw.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.119
He's never seen a knife before.

00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:01.580
Bangers.

00:02:01.664 --> 00:02:03.749
Look at that baby.

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:07.920
- We're doing it for Old Nick. - Come on. It's getting boring.

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:09.797
Go for it. This is your chance.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.382
- Come on. - Ettertje.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.092
Fingers.

00:02:19.723 --> 00:02:23.519
Is it clear that this is a fight to the death?

00:02:24.562 --> 00:02:26.272
No mercy.

00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:28.190
Yeah, Jimmy.

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.159
Are you watching, father?

00:02:40.244 --> 00:02:42.204
Meester.

00:02:42.288 --> 00:02:43.998
Dark Lord.

00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:49.295
Want to see if the boy has what it takes to become a finger?

00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:54.884
Nice.

00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:01.223
To fight.

00:03:01.307 --> 00:03:02.892
Come on up.

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:04.059
Grab him.

00:03:04.143 --> 00:03:05.686
Come on.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.354
Pak hem.

00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:10.941
Do you see this? I'll make it easy for you.

00:03:16.614 --> 00:03:17.948
Come on.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.243
- Come on, kid. - Do something.

00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:29.209
That's bad luck.

00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:30.794
That sure hurts.

00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:34.256
You drop your knife.

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.594
- Please. -Would you like to pick up your knife?

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.305
Come on then.

00:03:49.605 --> 00:03:51.065
Stupid bastard.

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:54.401
- You're making a game of it. - Stay out of this.

00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:56.528
I know what I'm doing.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.240
I'm just teasing you.

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:04.078
Come on, take it.

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:07.247
Pick up.

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:09.291
Too slow.

00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:13.963
- I could go on like this for hours. - Just finish it.

00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:16.298
- He's still small. - You know what?

00:04:16.382 --> 00:04:21.053
When I'm done with that bastard, I'm going to fight you. Do you want that?

00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:30.229
Little shit child.

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:32.731
I'm going to skin you with your own knife.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.159
You're fucked.

00:04:44.243 --> 00:04:46.662
- What do you mean? - He hit an artery.

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:48.205
Indeed.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.250
What blood.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.969
Then help me.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.348
- Don't laugh, help me. - It doesn't work that way.

00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:11.020
Jimmy's right. It doesn't work that way.

00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:23.323
- Why are you calling those jerks? - Please help me.

00:05:23.407 --> 00:05:26.577
- I'm scared. - Crybaby.

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:29.705
I become...

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.874
What are you going to be, Jimmy?

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:34.334
Are you getting hungry?

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.546
Are you getting horny?

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.008
Are you getting sleepy?

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.599
So sleepy.

00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:50.809
Poor target.

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:09.745
What's your name, kid?

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:17.377
- Spike.
- Spike? Nee.

00:06:17.461 --> 00:06:19.755
That doesn't sound good.

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:22.549
I think your name is...

00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:24.885
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:28.263
Your name is Jimmy.

00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:33.435
Jimmy.

00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:38.232
Howzat?

00:07:16.687 --> 00:07:18.105
For me.

00:12:26.455 --> 00:12:28.874
An infected patient.

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:37.340
Foreign. This could be a first, Samson.

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:39.468
Yes, you have a name.

00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:46.224
I gave it to you when I saw a new Alpha hunting in the woods.

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:53.982
I chose that name because of your build, your strength and your hair.

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:57.277
I'm Doctor Kelson.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:04.117
Although now I feel like Androclus pulling thorns from the lion's paw.

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:08.371
That means...

00:13:09.498 --> 00:13:12.501
...that you owe me.

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:19.966
Just kidding. Healthcare is free here.

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.636
I don't ask for anything.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.196
Interesting.

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:37.807
I trust you, Samson. I just decided that.

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:41.060
I have what you want here.

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:46.232
If you kill me and rip off my head, you won't get it.

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:51.654
This is a transaction. A quid pro quo.

00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:57.243
Although now I wonder if you understand Latin.

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:08.171
Oh, happy. Anyway.

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:37.325
I wonder if you understand anything I'm saying.

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:43.331
Maybe not so much the words...

00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:46.251
...but the intonation.

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:50.630
That I'm not a threat.

00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:54.008
I won't hurt you.

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:58.930
Do you recognize the sound of your name?

00:18:59.013 --> 00:19:00.640
Samson.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.192
How special would it be if you said something?

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:14.529
It would be a miracle...

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:19.242
...if it turns out that the infection...

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:24.539
...like a fog hangs over your brain, but there is still some of it left.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:30.295
Do you still have memories when you are so calm?

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:32.839
An idea of ​​who you once were?

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:37.510
Or am I just offering you a moment of peace?

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:43.975
There's nothing wrong with that either.

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:49.606
There's nothing wrong with a moment of peace.

00:20:01.492 --> 00:20:03.328
Niks mis mee.

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.583
There's nothing wrong with rest.

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:56.047
It's still over.

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.114
Samson.

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:25.493
You hero.

00:23:59.856 --> 00:24:01.065
Jonno.

00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:24.088
If he sees us, he will scream.

00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:29.177
Jonno, don't do that.

00:24:43.941 --> 00:24:46.194
- Help. - Run.

00:24:46.277 --> 00:24:47.695
En Jonno dan?

00:24:58.289 --> 00:24:59.707
Help.

00:25:00.208 --> 00:25:02.293
- Don't forget me. - Run.

00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:03.794
Guard.

00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:08.341
Don't leave me behind.

00:25:09.467 --> 00:25:11.052
Don't leave.

00:25:24.482 --> 00:25:25.942
Come on, Tom.

00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:27.652
Come along.

00:25:44.126 --> 00:25:46.629
- What should we say? - What happened.

00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:49.757
- We lost Jonno. - Own fault.

00:26:12.196 --> 00:26:13.364
George.

00:26:14.365 --> 00:26:16.367
I have bad news.

00:26:18.327 --> 00:26:21.038
- I said... - We have visitors.

00:26:21.122 --> 00:26:22.123
What?

00:26:23.207 --> 00:26:24.542
We have visitors.

00:26:28.212 --> 00:26:32.967
- Let me introduce you. - Tinky Winky always had his bag with him.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.804
Except that one time. Of course you saw that coming.

00:26:38.055 --> 00:26:40.891
- Tinky Winky came back. - Typical.

00:26:40.975 --> 00:26:44.979
And Laa-Laa and Po didn't seem to have lost even one apple...

00:26:45.062 --> 00:26:47.231
...but the whole bag.

00:26:54.113 --> 00:26:56.532
Don't know the Teletummies?

00:26:58.075 --> 00:26:59.994
They're great.

00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:02.496
They had televisions on their bellies.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:07.001
They watched themselves on TV with another TV on their stomach.

00:27:07.084 --> 00:27:09.670
They saw themselves in that too.

00:27:09.754 --> 00:27:13.674
That continued ad infinitum.

00:27:20.306 --> 00:27:22.808
Jimmima, do that Dipsy dance.

00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:04.975
Perfect.

00:28:05.059 --> 00:28:06.727
Howzat?

00:28:14.318 --> 00:28:16.320
What are you doing here?

00:28:20.282 --> 00:28:23.994
We enjoy the hospitality of these people.

00:28:24.078 --> 00:28:27.581
We are a group of wanderers who are hungry and tired.

00:28:27.665 --> 00:28:31.210
We were welcomed with open arms.

00:28:31.293 --> 00:28:33.796
- Were fed... - Welcomed?

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.758
- You interrupted me. - They were there all of a sudden.

00:28:37.842 --> 00:28:39.635
- The gate was open. - Not.

00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:46.517
We were welcomed and both our bellies and our hearts were filled.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.775
- Aren't we welcome? - You know that.

00:28:54.859 --> 00:28:57.945
Now it is. No, Dipsy dance.

00:29:11.125 --> 00:29:13.127
Oh, no.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.336
This is not...

00:29:15.004 --> 00:29:16.672
...good start.

00:29:18.048 --> 00:29:21.051
Let us introduce ourselves. Fingers.

00:29:29.143 --> 00:29:31.228
Roberto Calamari.

00:29:38.486 --> 00:29:40.112
Difficult audience.

00:29:41.197 --> 00:29:42.823
That's a joke.

00:29:42.907 --> 00:29:45.910
My name is also Jimmy. Our names are all Jimmy.

00:29:49.955 --> 00:29:51.499
Are you leaving?

00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:54.376
And.

00:29:56.212 --> 00:29:59.924
But only after we kill you.

00:30:03.511 --> 00:30:04.512
Get out.

00:30:32.498 --> 00:30:37.086
Old Nick won't be happy if she and the baby get away.

00:30:41.423 --> 00:30:45.719
We're staying here tonight to show charity.

00:30:45.803 --> 00:30:49.557
Tomorrow we move on. Go explore.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.475
Am I missing the charity?

00:30:52.643 --> 00:30:54.061
Red up.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.701
Tinky Winky and those damn apples.

00:31:08.784 --> 00:31:11.287
Did you see it coming?

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:15.583
Naturally. After the same story a million times.

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:53.681
I can't believe my goddamn eyes.

00:33:02.147 --> 00:33:05.234
Old Nick saw that humanity had failed...

00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:08.028
…and lived in conflict.

00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:15.661
That's why Old Nick sent his demons into the human world.

00:33:15.744 --> 00:33:21.959
Humanity perished under the demons and little was left of their world.

00:33:22.042 --> 00:33:23.794
And God did nothing.

00:33:25.129 --> 00:33:27.339
Because he was invisible.

00:33:27.423 --> 00:33:30.759
And couldn't even make a dent in a pack of butter.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.513
And so...

00:33:34.596 --> 00:33:38.976
...the human world became Old Nick's domain.

00:33:39.059 --> 00:33:41.270
And his domain was hell.

00:33:42.479 --> 00:33:43.564
Howzat?

00:33:47.401 --> 00:33:50.738
Then Old Nick spoke to his favorite son...

00:33:50.821 --> 00:33:52.948
...the one named Jimmy Crystal.

00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:55.534
And he said to Jimmy:

00:33:55.617 --> 00:33:59.121
“You are now Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal.

00:33:59.204 --> 00:34:03.083
You will be my strong right hand.

00:34:03.167 --> 00:34:07.755
You will have seven fingers and each finger will be a claw.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.799
You will show charity to the people.

00:34:10.883 --> 00:34:15.262
And therefore you will be my sole heir to the throne.

00:34:15.345 --> 00:34:19.725
And your seven fingers will hold your crown.”

00:34:21.685 --> 00:34:23.103
Howzat?

00:34:28.442 --> 00:34:33.447
I am Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.283
Old Nick's favorite son.

00:34:36.366 --> 00:34:38.118
These are my fingers.

00:34:38.202 --> 00:34:43.373
We travel the country searching for souls for my father.

00:34:43.457 --> 00:34:46.168
And we offer you...

00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:47.920
...charity.

00:34:50.798 --> 00:34:52.424
Jimmy's.

00:34:54.843 --> 00:34:57.805
Today our charity consists of...

00:35:01.642 --> 00:35:04.520
...removing the shirt.

00:35:07.773 --> 00:35:09.733
Please don't.

00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:45.352
- Hello, old man. - I'll make you cry and scream.

00:35:54.236 --> 00:35:55.529
Does that hurt?

00:36:20.596 --> 00:36:21.638
Jimmy.

00:36:22.973 --> 00:36:24.391
I can't...

00:36:25.684 --> 00:36:27.895
Do something about it, Jimmy Ink.

00:36:30.439 --> 00:36:33.442
You can't get away from it. This is what we do.

00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:37.029
I can't.

00:36:38.989 --> 00:36:40.407
Please.

00:36:43.452 --> 00:36:44.870
I can't.

00:36:46.246 --> 00:36:47.664
Please.

00:36:51.418 --> 00:36:53.045
Just wait here.

00:37:23.033 --> 00:37:24.451
Samson.

00:37:26.036 --> 00:37:27.663
My friend.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.501
We have something to discuss.

00:37:34.503 --> 00:37:40.467
The remedy I'm giving you is a mix of different things.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:46.431
But the most important ingredient is morphine.

00:37:46.515 --> 00:37:51.895
And at these quantities it will be gone in two weeks.

00:37:51.979 --> 00:37:53.730
Over the past 28 years...

00:37:53.814 --> 00:37:57.943
...I searched every medicine cabinet for miles around.

00:37:59.736 --> 00:38:01.905
There is no more.

00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:10.288
So it is inevitable that the peace you have found with me...

00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:12.708
...comes to an end.

00:38:15.669 --> 00:38:18.505
But I can offer you something else.

00:38:25.637 --> 00:38:28.015
A different kind of rest.

00:38:28.098 --> 00:38:31.727
A place in the ossuary.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:35.022
A kind of final resting place.

00:38:36.064 --> 00:38:37.482
With me.

00:38:46.074 --> 00:38:49.327
I want to give you eternal rest, Samson.

00:38:50.454 --> 00:38:55.667
I think you want peace too. That's why we became friends.

00:38:55.792 --> 00:38:57.210
Good friends.

00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:05.677
If only you could give permission somehow.

00:39:08.972 --> 00:39:11.975
Even if it's just a nod.

00:39:43.298 --> 00:39:45.467
Good night, Samson.

00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:51.181
Maan.

00:39:56.019 --> 00:39:57.521
Did you say...

00:39:58.897 --> 00:40:00.315
Samson.

00:40:02.359 --> 00:40:04.111
You said something.

00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:07.656
Say that again.

00:40:09.991 --> 00:40:11.409
Maan.

00:40:16.498 --> 00:40:17.916
Maan.

00:41:15.557 --> 00:41:18.185
I need strong fingers.

00:41:18.268 --> 00:41:21.688
Strong fingers make a strong fist.

00:41:21.771 --> 00:41:24.649
Listen. Concentration.

00:41:34.576 --> 00:41:36.786
Who do you want to fight?

00:41:39.414 --> 00:41:44.461
If you win, you take that spot and I'll call you Jimmy.

00:41:45.795 --> 00:41:49.007
If you lose, you get charity.

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:52.135
If you refuse, you will receive charity.

00:41:55.764 --> 00:41:58.433
Shake yes or no.

00:42:08.276 --> 00:42:09.819
Nice.

00:42:13.323 --> 00:42:17.452
Which finger do you want to fight?

00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:47.315
Her.

00:42:50.443 --> 00:42:52.070
I choose her.

00:43:14.092 --> 00:43:15.719
Vader.

00:43:16.803 --> 00:43:20.056
Master. Dad.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:23.310
King of kings.

00:43:23.393 --> 00:43:24.853
Join us.

00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:33.069
Yes, we are very grateful.

00:43:33.153 --> 00:43:34.779
We are grateful.

00:43:36.072 --> 00:43:38.658
Old Nick is hier, Jimmy's.

00:43:39.492 --> 00:43:41.995
He looks through my eyes.

00:43:42.078 --> 00:43:45.165
He smells the blood and the fear.

00:43:45.248 --> 00:43:49.377
He whispers something. I feel his lips against my ear.

00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:50.545
He says:

00:43:53.006 --> 00:43:54.507
'To fight.'

00:43:58.678 --> 00:44:00.889
Just fight, damn it.

00:44:17.947 --> 00:44:19.157
Come on.

00:44:33.463 --> 00:44:34.589
Too easy.

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:36.883
It seems easy, son of a bitch.

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:08.081
Time to take naps.

00:45:08.164 --> 00:45:09.582
Dipsy, Day-by-Day.

00:45:09.666 --> 00:45:10.875
Dumb people struggle.

00:45:10.917 --> 00:45:12.961
He tries to get up.

00:45:21.594 --> 00:45:23.012
Again.

00:45:27.934 --> 00:45:30.979
Nicely done, Jimmima.

00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:34.399
His pain delights Old Nick.

00:45:36.526 --> 00:45:39.112
Old Nick says:

00:45:39.195 --> 00:45:40.613
'Charity.'

00:45:41.448 --> 00:45:43.199
Just choose how.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.667
I want to take off his pants.

00:45:54.419 --> 00:45:56.337
Old Nick says, 'Perfect.'

00:45:59.591 --> 00:46:01.176
He shits his pants.

00:46:17.567 --> 00:46:20.028
See those other fuckers?

00:46:20.111 --> 00:46:22.113
Listen.

00:46:22.197 --> 00:46:25.116
They just stabbed you in the neck.

00:46:26.743 --> 00:46:28.161
But not me.

00:46:32.749 --> 00:46:36.002
You chose me because you thought I was weaker.

00:46:40.006 --> 00:46:42.634
What will you think later...

00:46:42.675 --> 00:46:45.762
...if I take your skin...

00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:01.319
My cat is lost.

00:47:01.402 --> 00:47:02.820
My cat.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.035
Verse kitten.

00:47:25.802 --> 00:47:27.637
What do we get now?

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.265
Up there.

00:47:31.808 --> 00:47:35.395
Stupid fucking bitch. Grab her.

00:47:35.478 --> 00:47:36.854
Stupid woman.

00:47:38.064 --> 00:47:40.567
- I'll kill you, you bitch. - Grab her.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.694
Behind it.

00:47:42.777 --> 00:47:44.612
- There she is. - Where?

00:47:45.572 --> 00:47:48.283
- Where then? - There, you see her.

00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:52.078
I want her alive.

00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:53.955
Alive.

00:47:54.038 --> 00:47:56.541
Come on out.

00:47:57.875 --> 00:48:00.461
- We're coming. - Show yourself.

00:48:00.545 --> 00:48:01.796
Up.

00:48:28.197 --> 00:48:30.033
What a scream.

00:48:33.328 --> 00:48:35.830
You always have that with charity.

00:48:40.043 --> 00:48:43.004
Although this does sound different than normal.

00:48:43.087 --> 00:48:45.089
Do you think that sounds normal?

00:48:50.219 --> 00:48:52.847
What does screaming normally sound like?

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.016
Like people who are terrified.

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.062
I keep going.

00:49:07.737 --> 00:49:09.155
Break up.

00:49:10.365 --> 00:49:11.783
Break up.

00:49:19.999 --> 00:49:21.668
Please.

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:45.233
Boy. After her.

00:49:45.316 --> 00:49:47.318
Bring her to me.

00:49:57.078 --> 00:49:58.121
Then now.

00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:29.819
Take me with you.

00:50:33.448 --> 00:50:36.701
Please. Take me with you.

00:50:51.215 --> 00:50:52.383
Thank you.

00:51:27.335 --> 00:51:28.878
He's dead.

00:51:49.315 --> 00:51:50.733
You are alone.

00:51:55.822 --> 00:51:59.742
I told you to bring that woman to me, right?

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:04.664
The woman who split Jimmima's skull with a huge hook.

00:52:06.415 --> 00:52:09.126
Why did you let her go?

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:12.463
- I didn't let her go. - Where is she then?

00:52:15.174 --> 00:52:17.218
She tried to escape.

00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:20.388
She fought back and I had to kill her.

00:52:20.471 --> 00:52:22.682
She fought back, Jimmy's.

00:52:22.765 --> 00:52:24.267
She fought back.

00:52:25.476 --> 00:52:28.145
Jimmy here had no choice.

00:52:29.063 --> 00:52:32.775
He was in danger of being overpowered by...

00:52:32.859 --> 00:52:34.944
By a pregnant woman.

00:52:38.823 --> 00:52:40.575
How did you kill her?

00:52:41.742 --> 00:52:42.785
With an arrow.

00:52:42.869 --> 00:52:44.453
Where is her body?

00:52:47.999 --> 00:52:49.417
It was dark.

00:52:51.502 --> 00:52:53.796
Somewhere in the woods.

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:56.465
Difficult to find, surely?

00:52:58.301 --> 00:53:03.556
Couldn't you have cut her face off and brought it to me?

00:53:03.639 --> 00:53:05.725
Or her unborn child?

00:53:05.808 --> 00:53:09.186
Something that had shown even a little initiative.

00:53:11.898 --> 00:53:14.734
- Why are you crying? - I'm not crying.

00:53:15.943 --> 00:53:19.363
- Sorry. - You shouldn't say that to me.

00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:22.658
You disappointed Old Nick.

00:53:23.659 --> 00:53:25.786
Should I call him in?

00:53:27.038 --> 00:53:32.251
And ask if he accepts your apology or wants more?

00:53:32.335 --> 00:53:37.214
- That we'll cut your damn head off or something. - Please don't.

00:53:37.298 --> 00:53:39.258
Call him over.

00:53:40.426 --> 00:53:44.347
- Ask if I can give the charity. - Do you want to do it?

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:46.682
Jimmima is dead because of him.

00:53:46.766 --> 00:53:49.852
If he hadn't run, he would have been chosen.

00:53:49.936 --> 00:53:53.314
He doesn't deserve to be a finger.

00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:56.233
Then look at how he's shaking.

00:53:57.485 --> 00:53:59.111
I agree.

00:54:00.738 --> 00:54:03.824
We have to ask Old Nick what to do.

00:54:03.908 --> 00:54:06.577
Yes, I think so too.

00:54:06.661 --> 00:54:08.871
- I'll call him over. - No.

00:54:10.581 --> 00:54:14.001
- We have to ask him personally. - What do you mean?

00:54:14.794 --> 00:54:17.213
We have to ask him personally.

00:54:17.296 --> 00:54:22.093
- Old Nick doesn't just appear. - Of course not, but I...

00:54:30.017 --> 00:54:31.435
I've seen him.

00:54:33.854 --> 00:54:35.982
Have you seen him?

00:54:36.065 --> 00:54:37.483
Earlier today.

00:54:38.859 --> 00:54:42.196
- Have you seen Old Nick? - With my own eyes.

00:54:44.573 --> 00:54:48.285
He had reddish skin and he was old.

00:54:48.369 --> 00:54:52.790
And there was a large structure made of human bones behind him.

00:54:52.873 --> 00:54:54.709
His palace, I think.

00:54:56.127 --> 00:54:59.547
And he was dancing around with one of his own demons.

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:01.549
An Alfa at that.

00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:05.261
An Alfa sat at his feet like a tame lamb.

00:55:12.226 --> 00:55:14.645
Should we ask Old Nick himself?

00:56:35.976 --> 00:56:38.395
Naloxone.

00:57:01.502 --> 00:57:03.879
It's daytime.

00:57:04.839 --> 00:57:06.257
Samson.

00:57:32.116 --> 00:57:33.284
Is it him?

00:57:35.703 --> 00:57:37.329
Is that really Old Nick?

00:57:40.457 --> 00:57:42.459
Is that really Old Nick?

00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:47.214
Is that really Old Nick?

00:57:57.433 --> 00:57:58.851
Would it?

00:58:07.401 --> 00:58:08.903
Yes, it's him.

00:58:08.986 --> 00:58:10.404
- Real? - Yes.

00:58:12.531 --> 00:58:14.867
- That's him. - Good heavens.

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:17.661
Lieve hel.

00:58:17.745 --> 00:58:19.038
Good, Jimmy.

00:58:19.121 --> 00:58:21.749
Did you know he would be here?

00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:25.252
- Did you lead us here? - Yes, that's right.

00:58:25.336 --> 00:58:31.008
I didn't know he would be here, in that castle. That's a surprise.

00:58:31.091 --> 00:58:32.843
But...

00:58:32.927 --> 00:58:36.597
...he has distributed several throughout his kingdom.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.807
Some nice ones in the Highlands.

00:58:38.891 --> 00:58:42.228
This must be new. That's why I didn't know it yet.

00:58:42.311 --> 00:58:46.565
- It seems to have been there for a while. - Yeah, it looks quite old.

00:58:46.649 --> 00:58:51.695
From the last five or ten years. That's not a long time in architecture.

00:58:51.779 --> 00:58:53.989
Are we going there?

00:58:54.073 --> 00:58:56.158
- To meet him? - No.

00:58:59.036 --> 00:59:01.580
Not until I talk to him.

00:59:02.831 --> 00:59:05.542
Maybe he doesn't want visitors.

00:59:05.626 --> 00:59:10.005
Trust me, you don't want to meet him when he's in a bad mood.

00:59:12.007 --> 00:59:13.676
You wait here.

00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:17.513
I'll talk to him.

00:59:17.596 --> 00:59:19.014
Right back.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.238
Hallo.

01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:50.290
Hallo.

01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:11.520
- Bent u Old Nick?
- Old Nick?

01:02:16.984 --> 01:02:22.489
- You're not Old Nick. - No. I don't know Old Nick.

01:02:22.573 --> 01:02:26.910
- Everyone knows him. - I really don't.

01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:29.663
- I'm Ian. - Ian?

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:33.041
Are you sure?

01:02:33.125 --> 01:02:34.460
Very sure.

01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:38.297
Old Nick is known for cheating on you.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:42.843
- He likes games. - Wait, it's Old Nick...

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:46.263
- ...you mean Satan? - Naturally.

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:48.265
Why do you think I...

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:54.688
Because of my skin color and my bones.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:57.983
Don't worry. I am not Satan.

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:03.363
- I'm Doctor Ian Kelson. - Doctor?

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:07.201
Who are these poor wretches then? Your patients?

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:10.746
That's an ossuary. A monument to the dead.

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:13.123
Some kind of cemetery.

01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:19.630
- And why is your skin orange? - That's iodine.

01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:21.256
Against the virus.

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.926
- The virus? - That causes the infection.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.597
A doctor.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.516
An atheist doctor.

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:41.401
You think the zombies are the result of science and bacteria and all that.

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:46.782
- What else? -Old Nick. His wrath on humanity.

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:48.492
I understand.

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:53.789
I'm an atheist and you're a satanist.

01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:59.169
Look at that. Mystery unraveled.

01:04:02.214 --> 01:04:06.885
I must admit that I was a bit short of breath. It makes me sweat.

01:04:06.969 --> 01:04:09.596
I thought I was going to meet my father.

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:14.268
- Did you do all this, Ian? - Yes.

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:18.021
I'm impressed. Nice work.

01:04:18.105 --> 01:04:22.526
Thank you. Did you just say you thought you were going to meet your father?

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:28.031
- My heart was beating like crazy. - Because Satan is your father.

01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:31.243
Old Nick is m'n ouwe.

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:33.745
But...

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:39.710
- Never mind. - I am always open to a conversation.

01:04:49.136 --> 01:04:52.889
I don't actually know my father that well.

01:04:54.266 --> 01:04:59.563
He often talks to me, but I never actually see him.

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:02.941
You talk to him, but you don't see him?

01:05:03.025 --> 01:05:06.445
- You hear him in your head. - Continuous.

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:14.036
I'm Jimmy.

01:05:15.954 --> 01:05:21.418
Actually it's Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal, but you can just say Jimmy.

01:05:24.463 --> 01:05:27.299
Shall we sit down for a moment?

01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:32.471
There are people waiting for me, but they're not going anywhere. No rush.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.557
Let's talk for a moment.

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:39.144
This is even worse.

01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:41.813
Belly, neck.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:47.861
Again. Come on.

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:52.699
- Sting, stab. - Is that all?

01:05:53.784 --> 01:05:56.745
- Is that all? Come on. -Jimmy.

01:05:56.828 --> 01:06:01.833
- What if that's not really Old Nick? - Not Old Nick?

01:06:03.752 --> 01:06:07.130
Orange skin. A palace of bones.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.133
He talks to demons.

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:13.804
- Who else could it be? - An old man.

01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:20.394
We better stay away from him. We should leave him alone.

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:23.230
Leave it alone?

01:06:25.524 --> 01:06:26.608
Nee.

01:06:28.694 --> 01:06:32.948
We don't do that. And it's not just an old man.

01:06:36.743 --> 01:06:38.161
That's Old Nick.

01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:44.876
It would be...

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.545
...foreign...

01:06:47.546 --> 01:06:50.132
...and great to meet him.

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:58.140
- I didn't mean anything by it. - It doesn't matter.

01:06:58.223 --> 01:06:59.808
Too easy.

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.534
What really matters...

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:22.038
...is whether Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal is his son.

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:25.208
Is he really a Sir Lord?

01:07:27.127 --> 01:07:28.545
What do you mean?

01:07:30.297 --> 01:07:33.300
Don't you ever think he's just talking around?

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:38.889
Bone castles in the Highlands? Bullshit. I'm hearing that for the first time.

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:42.017
I saw his look as he looked through the binoculars.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.352
He had never seen that before.

01:07:53.653 --> 01:07:56.281
I was eight when everything went to shit.

01:07:56.364 --> 01:08:00.243
But you probably still have memories of before.

01:08:00.327 --> 01:08:02.204
Less than you think.

01:08:03.205 --> 01:08:07.375
I remember details. Events, people.

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:15.008
But what it was like to live with shops, refrigerators...

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:19.012
...telephones and computers...

01:08:20.597 --> 01:08:23.225
I don't actually remember that.

01:08:24.851 --> 01:08:29.272
What I do remember is a sense of security.

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:34.236
There was order in the world.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.321
There was some kind of structure.

01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:41.910
Of course there was fuss and unrest, but...

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:43.829
...the foundation...

01:08:47.249 --> 01:08:49.334
...seemed indestructible.

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:54.881
I especially remember the church.

01:08:54.965 --> 01:08:59.010
We lived next door. That's where I hid when the demons came.

01:08:59.094 --> 01:09:02.848
- Did you live in the house next to the church? - Right next to it.

01:09:02.931 --> 01:09:05.183
- The official residence? - Yes.

01:09:06.351 --> 01:09:08.436
Your father was the preacher.

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:18.154
My mother and sisters would have survived if they had hidden there too.

01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:21.199
But they stayed home.

01:09:22.409 --> 01:09:24.494
Their heads were smashed.

01:09:26.413 --> 01:09:28.039
And your father?

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:34.462
He led the demons. He led them into the attack.

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:37.340
The leader of a great army.

01:09:39.467 --> 01:09:42.304
He always said, 'Charity begins at home.'

01:09:43.597 --> 01:09:47.559
- Was that the last time you saw him? - Yes.

01:09:48.268 --> 01:09:50.186
And then I saw you and...

01:09:58.904 --> 01:10:03.325
- I'm in a tough spot, Ian. - What do you mean?

01:10:04.326 --> 01:10:08.914
I told the rest you're Old Nick, but you're not.

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:12.751
- They hope to meet you. - Okay.

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:15.462
And you are also in a difficult position.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:20.133
- What do you mean? - If you can't help me...

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:24.304
...I'll shove your intestines down your throat until you choke on them.

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:30.936
That is indeed difficult.

01:10:31.019 --> 01:10:36.232
I like you. I can talk to you well. And I never like anyone.

01:10:36.316 --> 01:10:41.738
- Thank you. - Do you think we can work something out, Ian?

01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:49.454
They say the devil always wants to make a pact.

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:05.720
Tomorrow at nightfall we will have an audience with Old Nick.

01:11:07.222 --> 01:11:12.352
But you must follow certain rules when around the Dark Lord.

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:14.479
As is to be expected.

01:11:14.562 --> 01:11:21.361
If you touch it, you will go up in flames and your soul will go to the seventh circle.

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:23.989
Howzat?

01:11:24.072 --> 01:11:26.241
You are not allowed to speak to him.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:32.038
Only I can talk to him. His favorite son and heir apparent.

01:11:33.999 --> 01:11:35.709
Clearly?

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:56.396
Memento mori, I said to that boy.

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:03.194
I haven't been afraid of death in years.

01:12:04.195 --> 01:12:05.613
I'm alone.

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:09.325
My work is done.

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:11.745
But today...

01:12:12.871 --> 01:12:14.497
...I was scared.

01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:19.586
I thought: what will happen to Samson when I'm gone?

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:24.466
They're coming back tomorrow, so I want to try something tonight.

01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:29.304
I wanted to do it gradually, but...

01:12:30.597 --> 01:12:33.683
...given the circumstances...

01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:36.227
...we take a leap of faith.

01:12:36.311 --> 01:12:41.149
I have developed a theory about the nature of the infection.

01:12:41.232 --> 01:12:44.778
We know there is a physical response.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:48.573
Bleeding and explosive cell growth.

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:53.453
And we know that certain feelings occur.

01:12:53.536 --> 01:12:59.959
Pain and terrible restlessness, which is suppressed by the morphine.

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:05.507
But perhaps there is also a psychological aspect.

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:10.386
When infected attack, what do they see?

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:12.931
Who do they think they are attacking?

01:13:13.014 --> 01:13:17.227
I've seen them kill children and babies.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.813
A baby is not a threat.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:24.526
So they must be seeing something that isn't really there.

01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:27.403
They see something that isn't there.

01:13:27.487 --> 01:13:30.198
Doctors call this a psychosis.

01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:33.952
And they would say that can be treated.

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:37.372
I'm a doctor, Samson.

01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:41.376
I want to try to treat your psychosis.

01:13:45.255 --> 01:13:49.259
I would like to ask you to take these tablets.

01:15:26.606 --> 01:15:29.859
- Where do you think you're going? - I just wanted...

01:15:29.943 --> 01:15:33.238
- You wanted to escape. - No, Jimmy.

01:15:34.614 --> 01:15:38.034
The boy you stabbed was my best friend.

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:41.955
I lost him because of you. You were just lucky.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:48.086
To honor him, I think it would be appropriate if I slowly insert this knife into you...

01:16:07.814 --> 01:16:09.816
Where did you want to go?

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:14.862
- Somewhere. Everything is better than here. - I've been everywhere.

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:17.740
It's better nowhere.

01:16:22.954 --> 01:16:25.081
You better stay with me.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:29.544
Together we will make it through.

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:37.093
Did he want to escape?

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:42.390
He didn't dare to meet Old Nick. He couldn't handle that.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:48.730
I couldn't convince him.

01:16:49.731 --> 01:16:51.357
He started to fight.

01:16:53.318 --> 01:16:54.944
I had to kill him.

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.239
It didn't happen that way.

01:16:59.991 --> 01:17:01.826
That's how it happened.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:19.260
We'll see what Old Nick has to say tonight.

01:17:24.932 --> 01:17:27.018
Samson.

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:42.867
Did it work, my friend?

01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:48.331
Were you lost and have you now been found again?

01:20:04.634 --> 01:20:08.763
Good afternoon. You are on the train to Edinburgh.

01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:11.474
The next stop is Retford.

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:17.855
Don't forget your luggage and don't leave any rubbish behind.

01:20:17.939 --> 01:20:22.235
Have your ticket ready to leave the station.

01:20:23.069 --> 01:20:24.487
Tickets.

01:20:34.205 --> 01:20:35.665
Can I see your card?

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.876
Your ticket, honey.

01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:48.135
Card.

01:20:56.936 --> 01:20:59.355
I don't have a ticket.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.051
We turn it up really hard.

01:23:16.909 --> 01:23:19.286
He's expecting us, Jimmy's.

01:23:22.415 --> 01:23:23.916
Howzat?

01:24:42.328 --> 01:24:47.082
Woe to the earth and the sea.

01:24:47.166 --> 01:24:50.795
For the devil sends the beast with his wrath...

01:24:50.878 --> 01:24:55.090
...knowing he has little time.

01:24:55.174 --> 01:24:59.428
Let everyone who has understanding decipher the number of the beast.

01:24:59.512 --> 01:25:01.972
Because it is a human number.

01:25:02.056 --> 01:25:06.519
And that number is 666.

01:25:10.356 --> 01:25:12.191
I left alone

01:25:13.484 --> 01:25:15.027
My head was empty

01:25:16.487 --> 01:25:18.864
I needed time to think

01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:21.325
To bring back the memories

01:25:22.827 --> 01:25:24.411
What did I see?

01:25:25.496 --> 01:25:28.457
Can I believe

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:30.918
That what I saw that night

01:25:31.085 --> 01:25:33.921
Was real and not fantasy?

01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:36.757
Because in my dreams

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:39.969
Is it always present

01:25:40.719 --> 01:25:43.806
The evil face that confuses my mind

01:25:43.973 --> 01:25:47.309
And drives me to despair

01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:02.491
The night was black

01:26:02.575 --> 01:26:04.535
There was no point in holding back

01:26:05.828 --> 01:26:07.079
Because I had to see it

01:26:07.246 --> 01:26:10.082
Was someone watching me?

01:26:10.583 --> 01:26:12.001
Musty linen

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:14.628
Moving dark figures

01:26:14.795 --> 01:26:16.589
Was this all real?

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:19.800
Or some hell

01:26:19.967 --> 01:26:22.052
666

01:26:22.386 --> 01:26:24.513
The number of the beast

01:26:24.805 --> 01:26:27.141
Offers

01:26:27.308 --> 01:26:28.976
Will take place tonight

01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:49.455
I will come back

01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:52.625
I will return

01:26:53.459 --> 01:26:55.753
And own your body

01:26:56.462 --> 01:26:58.589
And I will let you burn

01:26:59.506 --> 01:27:01.675
I will have the fire

01:27:02.635 --> 01:27:04.720
I will have the strength

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:06.805
And the power

01:27:07.056 --> 01:27:10.225
To let my evil triumph

01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:14.104
666

01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:16.190
The number of the beast

01:27:16.857 --> 01:27:18.776
Offers

01:27:18.943 --> 01:27:20.861
Will take place tonight

01:28:22.548 --> 01:28:23.549
Howzat?

01:28:26.135 --> 01:28:27.636
Fingers?

01:28:31.724 --> 01:28:33.142
Fingers.

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:35.894
Come closer.

01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:47.531
Come closer.

01:28:48.532 --> 01:28:51.118
See there. You...

01:28:52.119 --> 01:28:56.665
...are the fingers of my right hand.

01:28:56.749 --> 01:29:01.128
Your dark radiance obscures even the sunlight.

01:29:01.211 --> 01:29:05.883
Pride fills me like maggots the body of Christ.

01:29:07.718 --> 01:29:09.636
Kneel.

01:29:11.597 --> 01:29:14.099
Not you, my son.

01:29:14.183 --> 01:29:16.018
You remain standing.

01:29:18.604 --> 01:29:21.982
We are very grateful to you for this audience.

01:29:22.066 --> 01:29:26.779
My time is endless, but your time with me is short.

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:30.324
Understood, Almighty. We won't stay too long.

01:29:30.407 --> 01:29:35.746
Do you have any specific instructions for us before we go?

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:38.499
- Certainly. - Just tell me.

01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:42.544
I order you to continue your hellish mission.

01:29:42.628 --> 01:29:46.465
Continue our hellish mission.

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:52.012
The skinning and disembowelment of your wretched subjects.

01:29:52.096 --> 01:29:56.058
Dishonoring their bodies, making a sacrament of their torment.

01:29:56.141 --> 01:29:59.978
Making their screams echo through the air.

01:30:01.814 --> 01:30:04.316
Is that your order, father?

01:30:07.694 --> 01:30:08.695
And.

01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:12.491
And what else do you instruct us to do?

01:30:15.369 --> 01:30:19.039
The fingers must always obey you, my son.

01:30:19.123 --> 01:30:22.042
Obey me. Your son.

01:30:22.126 --> 01:30:24.878
Without questions or doubts.

01:30:24.962 --> 01:30:28.799
Submit to my will...

01:30:28.882 --> 01:30:32.928
...without a trace of hesitation or defiance.

01:30:33.011 --> 01:30:35.264
Without a damn contradiction.

01:30:38.767 --> 01:30:41.603
And what is your last commandment, my king?

01:30:47.317 --> 01:30:49.361
Father, what is your last commandment?

01:30:52.489 --> 01:30:55.450
You will expand the number of fingers.

01:30:55.534 --> 01:31:00.414
Grow the fingers from one fist to two fists.

01:31:00.497 --> 01:31:04.042
And then five. And then a hundred. And then a thousand.

01:31:04.126 --> 01:31:07.296
So that no fellowship in the kingdom of hell...

01:31:07.379 --> 01:31:10.883
...can defend itself against our charity.

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:17.764
Father, we have heard your commands and we will obey them.

01:31:17.848 --> 01:31:19.349
Sta op, Jimmy's.

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.896
We have to go now.

01:31:34.323 --> 01:31:35.741
Guard.

01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:37.576
- Guard? - Guard.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:49.922
Spike?

01:31:56.511 --> 01:31:59.431
- I have one more commandment. - Another one?

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:02.935
No, I didn't think so.

01:32:03.018 --> 01:32:07.356
Continue our work, grow stronger, obey me. That's it.

01:32:07.439 --> 01:32:10.442
- There's one more thing. - Oh, yes?

01:32:12.027 --> 01:32:14.154
And what exactly?

01:32:14.238 --> 01:32:17.991
I demand a sacrifice.

01:32:18.075 --> 01:32:20.410
A sacrifice.

01:32:21.703 --> 01:32:23.163
From whom?

01:32:23.247 --> 01:32:27.584
You remember church, my only son.

01:32:30.170 --> 01:32:34.800
Then you also remember Christ, God's only son.

01:32:37.052 --> 01:32:41.390
And then you know that God's only son...

01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:46.103
...to go to heaven and sit at his father's side...

01:32:47.104 --> 01:32:51.525
...had to be crucified first.

01:32:57.739 --> 01:33:00.450
You are my only son, Jimmy.

01:33:02.703 --> 01:33:04.538
I am your god.

01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:07.916
I demand the same.

01:33:10.794 --> 01:33:14.172
- Do you want me to be crucified? - Yes.

01:33:15.549 --> 01:33:18.385
And who's going to nail me to that cross?

01:33:19.886 --> 01:33:21.346
She.

01:33:29.021 --> 01:33:33.233
You cheat. You've turned the tables.

01:33:33.317 --> 01:33:35.736
Take it easy, Jimmy Ink.

01:33:35.819 --> 01:33:39.072
I know you can't wait to strike.

01:33:40.282 --> 01:33:43.035
But think carefully.

01:33:43.118 --> 01:33:47.080
Do you really think that lanky old fart is Satan?

01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:51.376
If so...

01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:54.963
...could I do this?

01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:06.808
Kelson.

01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:10.729
I don't understand it. What's happening?

01:34:13.023 --> 01:34:15.942
- Who's the devil? - That's me, Jimmy.

01:34:16.026 --> 01:34:17.527
I.

01:34:17.611 --> 01:34:21.490
Grab that fake bitch.

01:34:21.573 --> 01:34:23.492
- But... - No but.

01:34:23.575 --> 01:34:26.787
Do it now or I'll break your neck.

01:34:30.707 --> 01:34:31.833
Don't do that, Jimmy.

01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:02.697
Howzat?

01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:14.543
Kelson.

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:18.088
- I'm sorry. - It's okay, Spike.

01:35:19.214 --> 01:35:21.007
It doesn't matter.

01:35:21.091 --> 01:35:22.801
Do you know each other?

01:35:26.221 --> 01:35:31.852
- You're not Old Nick. - No. There isn't one.

01:35:33.937 --> 01:35:35.564
He doesn't exist.

01:35:37.607 --> 01:35:39.317
We are alone.

01:35:50.954 --> 01:35:53.123
It was quite a nice show.

01:35:56.543 --> 01:35:57.961
Thank you.

01:36:00.297 --> 01:36:04.301
I don't want to make it worse, but you're not going to make it.

01:36:04.384 --> 01:36:06.094
I know.

01:36:07.137 --> 01:36:13.310
Why didn't you just let us go? Then nothing would have happened.

01:36:13.393 --> 01:36:18.315
I suddenly saw that you were behind that mask, Spike.

01:36:18.398 --> 01:36:19.816
And I...

01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:24.654
I think you've suffered enough.

01:36:29.201 --> 01:36:32.037
There is still something I can do for you.

01:36:34.581 --> 01:36:36.416
Follow that last commandment.

01:37:00.690 --> 01:37:02.192
Spike dus?

01:37:05.695 --> 01:37:07.113
Kellie.

01:37:12.369 --> 01:37:14.579
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:37:52.867 --> 01:37:56.705
I don't hear his voice anymore.

01:37:56.746 --> 01:37:58.164
Ian.

01:38:01.293 --> 01:38:04.296
Why don't I hear his voice anymore?

01:38:32.949 --> 01:38:34.951
I want my mother.

01:39:02.228 --> 01:39:03.647
Kelson.

01:39:07.442 --> 01:39:08.860
Samson.

01:39:13.573 --> 01:39:14.991
Thank you.

01:39:19.371 --> 01:39:22.165
Memento mori.

01:40:08.712 --> 01:40:10.714
Vader.

01:40:13.383 --> 01:40:15.218
Vader.

01:40:18.263 --> 01:40:21.099
Vader.

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.727
Vader.

01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:28.857
Why have you left me?

01:40:30.024 --> 01:40:32.610
Why have you left me?

01:40:35.697 --> 01:40:37.115
Vader.

01:41:27.582 --> 01:41:32.921
After WWII, the world helped Germany and Japan rebuild.

01:41:33.004 --> 01:41:36.341
Within a generation their economies had recovered...

01:41:36.424 --> 01:41:40.136
...and surpassed many of their conquerors.

01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:42.639
Was that fair?

01:41:42.722 --> 01:41:46.893
Just think. It is not only fair, it is even desirable.

01:41:46.976 --> 01:41:49.854
Why would you help the defeated enemy?

01:41:49.938 --> 01:41:55.109
The reparations imposed on the enemy after WWI...

01:41:55.193 --> 01:41:58.488
...led to WWII.

01:41:59.781 --> 01:42:01.407
'48, Churchill.

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:05.703
'Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.'

01:42:05.787 --> 01:42:06.788
What did you say?

01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:10.834
'Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.'

01:42:15.463 --> 01:42:21.636
That becomes the foundation of European post-war political philosophy.

01:42:21.719 --> 01:42:23.555
Never forget.

01:42:24.389 --> 01:42:27.892
The ideas must be eradicated.

01:42:27.976 --> 01:42:33.982
Fascism, nationalism, populism. Wiped out. To never return.

01:42:35.358 --> 01:42:41.281
What does that have to do with Russia's post-Soviet economic landscape?

01:42:41.364 --> 01:42:47.453
I'm just saying that if it comes up on the test tomorrow...

01:42:47.537 --> 01:42:50.540
...you score points with the Weimar Republic.

01:42:50.623 --> 01:42:55.169
When it passes by? You take the test.

01:42:55.253 --> 01:42:56.880
I won't say more.

01:43:00.174 --> 01:43:01.259
What was that?

01:43:03.428 --> 01:43:04.846
Then listen.

01:43:13.938 --> 01:43:16.149
Do you remember what to do?

01:43:23.698 --> 01:43:24.782
There.

01:43:29.245 --> 01:43:32.457
- What do you see? - They're after two people.

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:38.338
Should we help them?

01:43:40.798 --> 01:43:42.800
Should we help them, Dad?

01:43:44.010 --> 01:43:46.596
Naturally. Come along.

01:49:05.331 --> 01:49:07.333
