WEBVTT

00:54.679 --> 00:56.514
Where is it?
Are we almost there?

00:57.390 --> 00:59.476
- Ah, here it is.
- Here we are!

00:59.797 --> 01:00.797
Whoo!

01:02.896 --> 01:03.896
Wow!

01:04.773 --> 01:07.734
This is exciting—I'll
finally get to try it!

01:08.140 --> 01:09.766
Man, I saved up for this.

01:09.823 --> 01:11.616
Two days. Two days!

01:11.681 --> 01:12.766
Two days, huh?

01:12.807 --> 01:13.807
Yeah!

01:15.325 --> 01:17.298
Nice place, right?

01:19.370 --> 01:21.456
Looks pretty cool
even from the outside.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.456
Yeah!

01:22.499 --> 01:23.499
This is different.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.920
The one near our place
seems like Christmas all year...

01:27.045 --> 01:28.379
because of all the lights.

01:28.713 --> 01:29.839
Ahh!

01:31.174 --> 01:33.843
Is this the one with...
the extra service?

01:33.927 --> 01:35.303
Yeah, this is it.

01:35.653 --> 01:36.653
But...

01:37.298 --> 01:38.656
it looks decent and normal.

01:38.681 --> 01:39.681
I think so too.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.310
It’s just a front — all
for show and safety.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.730
But... isn’t the police
gonna bust this place?

01:45.772 --> 01:46.856
That won't happen!

01:47.816 --> 01:49.025
Well...

01:49.818 --> 01:51.736
you've got us right?
You’re covering this!

01:51.778 --> 01:53.988
- That's right.
- Of course. This is my treat!

01:54.072 --> 01:57.116
Because we nailed
our thesis defense,

01:57.242 --> 02:01.162
- and we’re finally graduating!
- That’s right! Yeah!

02:01.221 --> 02:02.847
- Let’s get it!
- [laughing]

02:02.872 --> 02:04.666
It's massage time!

02:04.691 --> 02:05.776
- Oh!
- Go ahead.

02:05.801 --> 02:06.968
- You guys first.
- You should go first.

02:06.993 --> 02:08.012
- Why me?
- Who invited us?

02:08.037 --> 02:09.696
- Go ahead.
- You go first. Hurry up.

02:09.721 --> 02:12.795
- Fine. Too excited?
- Someone might see us. Hurry up!

02:13.152 --> 02:15.196
Hey, Joel! Come on!

02:16.378 --> 02:17.422
Suit yourself!

02:19.556 --> 02:22.141
- Hey, hold on. Be careful.
- Just excited.

02:22.166 --> 02:23.459
Good evening, Sir!

02:23.484 --> 02:24.561
Hi, good evening.

02:24.586 --> 02:26.229
Please choose your service.

02:26.715 --> 02:29.426
Of course, the
special Thai-Swedish.

02:29.590 --> 02:31.467
- Sure.
- Is Elise available?

02:31.875 --> 02:32.912
I’d like her again.

02:33.578 --> 02:37.791
- Sure, sir.
- Bro, I want the pretty and skilled one.

02:38.462 --> 02:39.588
The same with him, miss.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.080
Hmm? You want Elise too?

02:41.105 --> 02:42.490
Is Elise Thai-Swedish?

02:42.897 --> 02:43.913
Oh, she's a foreigner!

02:43.913 --> 02:45.039
[laughing]

02:45.556 --> 02:46.808
Kidding aside, anyone’s fine.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.335
Alright, sir. We have a lot
of pretty therapists here.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.045
- Nice!
- And with that...

02:51.340 --> 02:52.382
Room 19 for you,

02:53.463 --> 02:54.839
and Room 22 for you, sir.

02:55.073 --> 02:57.068
- So? Let’s go?
- Let’s go.

02:57.155 --> 02:58.448
Enjoy!

02:58.627 --> 02:59.628
Here we are!

02:59.722 --> 03:00.722
Come on!

03:01.937 --> 03:04.011
Uhm… this is your
first time, right?

03:05.502 --> 03:06.753
- Yes.
- I got it.

03:07.143 --> 03:08.936
I’ll give you the prettiest.

03:10.174 --> 03:11.197
Room 23.

03:17.826 --> 03:18.994
Enjoy, sir!

03:19.686 --> 03:21.187
Wish it was me.

03:30.625 --> 03:31.626
Come in.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.502
Hi, sir. Shall we start?

03:39.848 --> 03:42.221
Yes, same as before.
You already know it.

03:42.657 --> 03:43.825
You want it hard, right?

03:43.901 --> 03:44.901
Yes.

03:52.079 --> 03:53.164
Hi, sir!

03:54.378 --> 03:57.601
I’m Carla, I’ll be
your masseuse.

03:59.166 --> 04:00.287
Please lie down.

04:02.503 --> 04:03.716
We can do it standing too.

04:04.603 --> 04:06.342
We'll do the massage first.

04:07.307 --> 04:11.061
Or maybe… something
extra first? Can you do it?

04:11.763 --> 04:14.724
Let me show you how
good the massage feels first.

04:15.494 --> 04:16.954
You’re quite pretty, babe.

04:17.605 --> 04:18.857
[phone ringing]

04:19.841 --> 04:20.841
Hello?

04:25.421 --> 04:28.132
I can’t right now, babe.
I'm still at school.

04:28.682 --> 04:29.781
I’ll see you tomorrow.

04:32.395 --> 04:33.395
Bye.

04:37.449 --> 04:38.898
Come on. Let's start.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.276
So, shall we continue?

05:25.912 --> 05:27.413
Of course. Let's get back to it.

05:27.536 --> 05:28.913
Same price as before.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.814
Yeah, I've got you.

10:17.740 --> 10:19.025
- Hello!
- Oh?

10:19.872 --> 10:20.931
Hi.

10:21.475 --> 10:22.893
Sir, I’m Ina.

10:23.146 --> 10:25.777
You may take the robe off
and lie face down.

10:28.347 --> 10:29.514
Uhm, miss?

10:30.568 --> 10:31.897
This is a bit embarrassing…

10:32.215 --> 10:34.529
But you'd actually be the…

10:35.076 --> 10:38.037
you’d be the first woman
to ever see my body.

10:38.987 --> 10:42.232
Hmm, but you’ve got a nice body.

10:47.291 --> 10:48.945
Uh, miss...

10:50.245 --> 10:51.758
Have you been working here long?

10:53.500 --> 10:57.297
Honestly... it’s my first day here.

10:58.328 --> 11:00.171
It's my first time
giving a massage too.

11:00.943 --> 11:02.433
I guess we're the same.

11:03.562 --> 11:05.440
It's my first time
getting a massage.

11:07.851 --> 11:11.601
Ah, miss… could you
press harder there?

11:12.079 --> 11:15.457
That part of my
body is kind of sore.

11:16.525 --> 11:19.612
Sure, sir. You must
be tired a lot, huh?

11:19.637 --> 11:21.140
And sleep-deprived!

11:21.653 --> 11:23.650
I have a lot going on at school.

11:24.073 --> 11:25.096
Hmm...

11:26.923 --> 11:28.550
That's it!

11:28.978 --> 11:31.280
Miss, rub those
muscles right there.

11:31.855 --> 11:38.237
If you feel a hard spot when
you press, that means it’s a knot.

11:40.170 --> 11:41.258
Wait a second.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.006
I’ll teach you.

11:47.638 --> 11:52.137
See, if you feel something hard,
press it down.

11:53.961 --> 11:55.219
Massage it harder.

11:57.453 --> 11:58.485
Does it feel good?

11:59.055 --> 12:00.099
Mm-hmm.

12:02.062 --> 12:03.980
Okay, lie face down.

12:04.511 --> 12:05.554
Pardon me?

12:06.989 --> 12:08.316
I’ll show you how to do it.

12:18.284 --> 12:20.298
You actually know how
to give a massage, huh?

12:20.323 --> 12:27.758
Ah, yeah. I used to watch
my mom massage my dad.

12:28.100 --> 12:32.187
You know, you’re the first person
who’s ever given me a massage.

12:32.367 --> 12:33.408
Really?

12:33.977 --> 12:37.358
You give massages, but
no one ever gives you one?

12:46.087 --> 12:47.194
Sir!

12:49.231 --> 12:51.751
Now it’s my turn.
Lie down again.

12:52.244 --> 12:53.268
Alright.

13:06.748 --> 13:07.802
Oh, sorry!

13:09.120 --> 13:10.129
It’s okay.

13:13.237 --> 13:14.270
Sir?

13:15.993 --> 13:17.661
Would you like something extra?

13:19.492 --> 13:20.651
I’m kind of shy.

13:21.744 --> 13:25.038
It won’t be much,
I'll take care of you.

14:16.188 --> 14:20.318
Sir, come back anytime, okay?
Look for me… if you want me again.

14:23.535 --> 14:25.097
Can I get your number?

14:29.898 --> 14:32.242
Uh… I don’t have any paper.

14:50.277 --> 14:51.305
Can I take you out sometime?

14:57.796 --> 14:58.809
And your number?

15:22.564 --> 15:25.505
[laughing]

15:25.754 --> 15:27.589
Seems like you're
having a lot of fun, Ikiboy?

15:27.662 --> 15:29.748
I just remembered Carla, man.

15:29.783 --> 15:31.846
- The one who massaged me last night.
- Oh? Mm-hmm.

15:31.871 --> 15:33.990
Man, she really knows
how to press just right.

15:34.413 --> 15:35.497
Solid!

15:35.596 --> 15:36.597
Totally worth it, right?

15:36.665 --> 15:38.751
Exactly!

15:39.317 --> 15:40.902
- That’s what I like!
- [sighs]

15:41.041 --> 15:43.085
Ina is really gorgeous, man!

15:43.195 --> 15:46.038
- Hmm?
- Yeah. I want to see her again.

15:46.101 --> 15:48.195
Oh, looks like someone’s addicted
to the spa's extra service, huh?

15:48.556 --> 15:52.593
This guy's got a girl already!
That’s solid, man!

15:52.618 --> 15:54.900
No, it’s not like that, man.

15:55.931 --> 15:58.663
It’s just… I’ve never felt
like this with any other girl.

15:59.475 --> 16:00.810
She’s just my type, you know?

16:01.443 --> 16:03.946
A Filipina beauty who...

16:04.663 --> 16:06.859
looks innocent, right?

16:07.368 --> 16:11.247
Nice. Joel’s in love!

16:11.552 --> 16:14.137
If I were you, I’d go after her!

16:14.162 --> 16:16.625
Iki, do you think
she’d go for me?

16:18.011 --> 16:20.860
Let’s do this, Joel.
Let’s make a bet.

16:21.498 --> 16:23.297
If you actually get
Ina to be your girl,

16:23.631 --> 16:26.455
I’ll buy drinks at the
graduation celebration.

16:27.008 --> 16:28.797
- All in!
- Wait a second.

16:28.865 --> 16:31.147
What if he didn't get
to make her his girl?

16:31.243 --> 16:32.453
Well, then he’ll
buy us the drinks!

16:32.478 --> 16:33.488
- That’s it!
- Let's go all out!

16:33.515 --> 16:34.702
But wait, hold on.

16:34.727 --> 16:38.239
She already gave me… her number.

16:38.264 --> 16:39.264
Damn!

16:39.293 --> 16:40.374
Are you for real?

16:40.417 --> 16:42.971
That’s what all the
pretty masseuses do!

16:43.339 --> 16:48.928
She’ll give you her number, so when
she’s out of options, she’ll call you.

16:48.995 --> 16:50.872
- Hmm…
- Wait, really?

16:50.897 --> 16:51.924
Yep, that’s how it goes.

16:51.949 --> 16:54.353
So, you, know that she
isn't actually into you.

16:54.777 --> 16:57.029
Hmm. So it’s a bet?

16:57.192 --> 16:58.568
Yeah, sure! A bet?

16:59.089 --> 17:00.423
Go! Challenge accepted.

17:00.494 --> 17:01.847
- That's a deal!
- Shit!

17:02.115 --> 17:03.551
- Deal!
- We're really making bets here!

17:03.603 --> 17:04.989
- You bet!
- It's literally on! It’s on!

17:05.014 --> 17:06.558
- Go!
- It's a bet!

17:14.599 --> 17:15.808
Come on in.

17:18.782 --> 17:21.149
Oh, sorry. Just a sec.

17:23.694 --> 17:24.944
Wait a sec.

17:27.539 --> 17:28.546
There.

17:29.900 --> 17:30.926
Your family?

17:31.820 --> 17:32.820
Where?

17:33.436 --> 17:34.452
Oh, that one?

17:35.098 --> 17:36.098
Yeah.

17:36.251 --> 17:38.034
We’re actually from Baguio.

17:38.994 --> 17:40.037
Have a seat.

17:40.565 --> 17:44.235
Oh, just a sec. Sorry.

17:46.351 --> 17:47.843
All done.

17:54.348 --> 17:57.309
My dad left us
when I was little.

17:57.707 --> 17:58.889
He went off with someone else.

17:59.471 --> 18:02.771
My mom got sick, so
now she stays at home.

18:03.545 --> 18:06.507
My siblings have
their own families now.

18:06.805 --> 18:10.100
So, as the youngest, I’m
the one taking care of Mom.

18:11.082 --> 18:12.945
I have to work for her sake.

18:14.216 --> 18:15.258
Hmm...

18:15.716 --> 18:19.095
Our family has a
business in Baguio.

18:19.868 --> 18:22.294
Then they sent me to
school here in Manila.

18:23.112 --> 18:26.198
We’re actually just
renting this place.

18:26.763 --> 18:30.401
I’m the youngest too, so
I’m the only one still studying.

18:31.659 --> 18:33.335
That’s why they give me
everything I want.

18:34.673 --> 18:36.859
Wow! That’s really enviable.

18:36.897 --> 18:38.409
So you’re spoiled, huh?

18:38.936 --> 18:40.025
Oh, just a moment.

18:53.276 --> 18:54.276
Here.

18:58.691 --> 18:59.859
Thank you.

19:02.294 --> 19:03.504
You drink?

19:03.816 --> 19:04.858
I do.

19:07.557 --> 19:09.017
Doesn't look like it, huh?

19:09.695 --> 19:14.357
I’m not like some
spoiled brats, you know?

19:16.240 --> 19:17.836
I was raised well.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.013
I grew up well.

19:21.103 --> 19:22.103
Cheers?

19:22.689 --> 19:23.689
Cheers!

19:28.380 --> 19:29.840
You know, Ina,

19:30.464 --> 19:33.425
I still feel shy thinking
about the fact that...

19:34.131 --> 19:35.732
I’m with the one who...

19:37.259 --> 19:40.470
gave me the "spa treatment".

19:41.029 --> 19:42.059
You know what I mean.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.309
[chuckles]

19:43.353 --> 19:45.507
Come on, it’s just work.

19:46.984 --> 19:49.945
Um... can I smoke here?

19:50.899 --> 19:52.067
Go ahead.

19:56.026 --> 19:57.110
Ina.

19:58.510 --> 20:00.137
Can I court you?

20:00.965 --> 20:02.216
[coughs]

20:03.664 --> 20:06.692
[laughs]

20:07.238 --> 20:09.574
You’re really good
at making jokes, huh?

20:09.655 --> 20:11.240
[awkward laugh]

20:11.343 --> 20:12.343
Hey.

20:12.981 --> 20:14.191
Let’s take a selfie!

20:14.550 --> 20:15.782
- Hmm.
- Come on, let’s go.

20:16.454 --> 20:17.454
Just a sec.

20:17.539 --> 20:18.539
There you go.

20:20.087 --> 20:21.087
Okay.

20:21.410 --> 20:23.036
One, two, three.

20:24.025 --> 20:25.443
One, two, three.

20:27.287 --> 20:28.330
One, two, three.

20:29.372 --> 20:30.372
One more.

20:30.993 --> 20:32.536
That's it!

20:33.440 --> 20:35.025
We look cute!

21:04.652 --> 21:06.082
You’re probably already drunk.

21:08.915 --> 21:11.406
No, just a little.

21:29.424 --> 21:30.606
Come on, I’ll take you home.

21:31.233 --> 21:32.567
So you can take a rest.

21:34.304 --> 21:35.555
Oh, that's right.

21:35.976 --> 21:38.706
I still have work at the
restaurant tomorrow morning.

21:39.579 --> 21:40.579
Huh?

21:41.543 --> 21:43.127
You work at a restaurant?

21:43.391 --> 21:44.395
Mm-hmm.

21:44.460 --> 21:45.836
Where?

21:46.307 --> 21:49.787
I work as a waitress in
the morning, near the spa.

21:50.124 --> 21:51.751
At the tapsilog joint.

21:52.017 --> 21:54.978
It’s that place with the red roof.
Do you know it?

21:55.360 --> 21:56.403
Oh, wow.

21:57.559 --> 21:59.804
You really have
no rest at all, huh?

22:02.360 --> 22:03.624
Yeah. I need this.

22:04.370 --> 22:06.545
Alright, come on.
I’ll take you home.

22:06.579 --> 22:07.947
So, you can take some rest.

22:08.758 --> 22:10.468
- Come on.
- I haven’t finished this yet.

22:10.727 --> 22:13.263
That’s enough. You need to rest.
You still have work tomorrow.

22:13.319 --> 22:16.295
- Just a few more.
- That’s enough. That’s enough.

22:16.844 --> 22:18.429
Let’s go. I’ll take you home.

22:18.779 --> 22:19.779
Come on.

22:22.034 --> 22:23.542
- Can you still walk?
- I can.

22:26.491 --> 22:27.614
I got this.

22:34.227 --> 22:35.854
- Man!
- Hey, boss!

22:35.854 --> 22:37.189
What's up? How's it going?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.816
I’ve noticed you’ve
been kind of MIA lately.

22:39.841 --> 22:41.759
Well, there’s no class, right?

22:41.791 --> 22:45.931
The other day, you weren’t there for the
meeting with the dean about graduation.

22:46.043 --> 22:47.962
What are you up to?

22:48.842 --> 22:51.720
You keep going
back to the spa, huh?

22:51.745 --> 22:53.709
- No, of course not!
- You’re feeling frisky, huh?

22:53.837 --> 22:55.299
- I’m always just at home.
- Really?

22:55.323 --> 22:56.433
- You guys know that.
- No way.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.019
- Besides…
- Looks like you’re going solo, huh?

22:58.044 --> 23:02.028
We’ve all been staying up late.
I’m just making up for lost sleep.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.533
We don't believe you.

23:04.665 --> 23:06.291
Maybe you're just…

23:06.551 --> 23:08.762
jacking yourself off!

23:09.022 --> 23:10.648
Well, the question here is…

23:10.781 --> 23:14.576
is my name Iki
who loves coochie?

23:14.601 --> 23:16.303
[all laughing]

23:16.328 --> 23:18.121
Coochie! That's a killer!

23:18.146 --> 23:19.856
Hey, stay here.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.441
You can’t take a joke.

23:21.567 --> 23:22.567
Stay here.

23:22.592 --> 23:24.928
So, this is how you pass
the jokes around, huh?

23:34.012 --> 23:35.012
Hey!

23:35.243 --> 23:36.494
What are you doing here?

23:36.578 --> 23:38.705
Well, they said you
weren’t available.

23:38.794 --> 23:39.794
Oh!

23:40.762 --> 23:41.762
For you.

23:42.698 --> 23:43.923
You’re so sweet.

23:44.118 --> 23:45.244
Anything for you.

23:47.425 --> 23:48.760
You’re the best!

23:49.277 --> 23:52.447
Ina... don’t do any extra
service for your guest, please?

23:52.734 --> 23:55.075
Hey! That’s extra
income, you know.

23:55.963 --> 23:57.561
Just stick to giving massages.

23:58.843 --> 23:59.909
Why, though?

24:01.104 --> 24:02.886
Ah, never mind.

24:03.501 --> 24:04.751
Are you getting jealous?

24:05.059 --> 24:06.059
Hmm?

24:08.289 --> 24:11.250
I'll go ahead. My guest might
already be waiting in the room.

24:11.693 --> 24:13.198
Take care, okay? Thank you.

24:24.693 --> 24:26.588
Sir, let's start.

24:27.295 --> 24:28.581
Can we have sex?

24:31.826 --> 24:33.013
Sir, I apologize,

24:33.510 --> 24:34.683
but that’s not allowed here,

24:34.708 --> 24:37.453
and I don’t do that with
someone who’s not my boyfriend.

24:44.187 --> 24:45.627
What can you give
me with this, then?

24:50.924 --> 24:52.219
Let me see you
touching yourself.

25:46.595 --> 25:47.822
I’m not getting my
money’s worth here.

27:17.389 --> 27:18.389
Hey!

27:22.974 --> 27:23.974
Sir!

27:27.973 --> 27:29.323
That wasn’t part of the deal!

27:45.000 --> 27:46.688
I already bought fast food.

27:46.721 --> 27:47.728
Here.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.421
Oh, wow!

27:50.560 --> 27:52.895
You know, I rarely
get to eat this.

27:52.920 --> 27:53.936
It's a bit expensive for me.

27:53.960 --> 27:54.960
Really?

27:55.400 --> 27:57.107
- Mm-hmm.
- Don’t worry.

27:57.975 --> 27:59.602
From now on, every time
I pick you up,

28:00.658 --> 28:02.171
expect me to bring food.

28:02.534 --> 28:03.792
I have a question.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.084
Why are you even
wasting your time with me?

28:07.303 --> 28:11.432
Well, I’m courting you, right?
Don’t you like it?

28:13.202 --> 28:15.576
You’re the only crazy one
who does this to me.

28:15.964 --> 28:18.701
You know, when someone’s special to you,

28:19.201 --> 28:20.607
you take care of them.

28:21.190 --> 28:22.817
And you’re my type!

28:24.032 --> 28:25.502
You look innocent,

28:26.296 --> 28:27.416
you’re a Filipina beauty,

28:28.309 --> 28:29.925
you’re loving to your mom,

28:30.817 --> 28:33.987
and most of all,
you’re beautiful.

28:37.495 --> 28:40.457
So... how many girls have
you treated as "special"?

28:41.068 --> 28:42.320
You're the only one!

28:42.483 --> 28:43.505
Really?

28:43.849 --> 28:45.304
You don't believe me?

28:46.309 --> 28:48.164
I wasn’t into
courting back then.

28:49.302 --> 28:50.486
This is my first time.

28:51.215 --> 28:53.653
There were some who
showed interest, yeah, but…

28:54.190 --> 28:56.075
I didn’t really
make it a priority.

28:56.906 --> 28:59.714
I wanted to finish
my studies first.

29:00.104 --> 29:01.229
Just eat your food.

29:02.124 --> 29:04.493
Oh, so now that you’re graduating,

29:04.518 --> 29:06.906
you think you have the
right to sweet-talk girls?

29:06.961 --> 29:10.047
Of course not!
I’m not a smooth talker.

29:10.654 --> 29:11.687
I'm being serious.

29:13.333 --> 29:15.084
I'm serious too, Joel.

29:15.626 --> 29:17.754
My priority is my mom.

29:17.779 --> 29:19.030
And to save up.

29:19.266 --> 29:20.463
That love stuff…

29:22.055 --> 29:23.932
that can wait until I'm stable.

29:23.957 --> 29:27.544
We can still help each other
while we’re together, though.

29:27.569 --> 29:28.569
Together?

29:28.654 --> 29:32.185
What I meant was...

29:33.415 --> 29:34.710
if we end up together.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.420
Joel...

29:37.960 --> 29:39.660
We’re not going to be together.

29:42.221 --> 29:43.340
Don’t you like me?

29:46.859 --> 29:50.071
You know how hard it is to commit
with my current situation, right?

29:52.628 --> 29:54.338
Hmm…

29:58.387 --> 29:59.433
Ah, whatever!

30:00.759 --> 30:01.777
I'll just be here.

30:02.491 --> 30:03.785
I'll wait for you.

30:05.416 --> 30:07.472
- Go ahead, eat.
- You know, just eat your food.

30:07.511 --> 30:08.511
Hurry up!

30:13.603 --> 30:15.218
[phone ringing]

30:16.478 --> 30:18.098
[phone ringing]

30:19.211 --> 30:20.924
[phone ringing]

30:22.130 --> 30:23.710
[phone ringing]

30:24.912 --> 30:26.112
[phone ringing]

30:27.532 --> 30:28.798
Hello? Mom?

30:29.659 --> 30:31.797
It’s like you’ve
forgotten about us.

30:31.910 --> 30:33.870
You haven’t reached out.

30:34.195 --> 30:39.033
Mom... I’ve just been taking care
of my graduation requirements.

30:40.294 --> 30:44.215
Maybe you have a girlfriend now,
and you’re just not telling me.

30:44.332 --> 30:47.293
Mom, come on.
Is that what you think?

30:47.603 --> 30:48.805
Back when you
were in high school,

30:48.830 --> 30:51.280
you’d tell me everything,
even your crushes too.

30:51.368 --> 30:52.962
You’re really
something else, Mom.

30:53.742 --> 30:55.202
Um…

30:56.604 --> 30:57.604
Mom!

30:57.897 --> 31:02.735
There’s someone I like, but
I’m worried you might get mad.

31:03.496 --> 31:04.796
Why would I?

31:06.864 --> 31:11.369
Just promise me
you won’t get mad.

31:11.793 --> 31:16.506
Of course. You know me.
You know I’ve always got your back.

31:16.531 --> 31:19.110
Okay, so here’s
the thing, Mom...

31:19.771 --> 31:22.565
Me and my friends went to a spa.

31:22.800 --> 31:26.303
And the girl who was
massaging me there... she’s pretty!

31:27.013 --> 31:28.014
I like her!

31:28.397 --> 31:31.773
So now I’m courting her, Mom.

31:32.574 --> 31:35.785
Son, always think
about what’s important.

31:35.810 --> 31:38.229
You love the person you like.

31:38.783 --> 31:42.329
Don’t be like me, who got
married to someone I didn’t like.

31:42.915 --> 31:45.126
But I don’t regret it!

31:45.151 --> 31:49.090
Your dad was a very good provider
for us when he's still alive.

31:49.877 --> 31:53.416
I know, Mom. I know
you loved Dad, too.

31:53.987 --> 31:55.747
That’s why I’m telling you,

31:55.772 --> 31:58.305
no matter who they are,
or what they do,

31:58.449 --> 32:01.269
as long as you treat them
with respect, and you love them,

32:01.294 --> 32:02.420
that’s perfectly fine.

32:03.087 --> 32:05.798
You’ll still have a lot to
learn from that experience.

32:07.353 --> 32:08.591
Thanks, Mom.

32:09.145 --> 32:10.646
That’s why I love you so much.

32:10.978 --> 32:12.279
I love you too, my son.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.098
I miss you, Mom.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.638
- Bye.
- Bye.

32:27.337 --> 32:28.588
Good evening, sir.

32:28.613 --> 32:29.864
Same as usual, please.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.993
But I’ll try someone
different this time.

32:32.581 --> 32:34.208
I'd like Ina tonight.

32:34.295 --> 32:36.088
Of course, sure.

32:36.512 --> 32:37.765
And how about you?

32:38.790 --> 32:41.668
Hey, wasn’t it always
Elise you’d request?

32:41.751 --> 32:42.794
Yeah, that’s right.

32:44.091 --> 32:45.259
Well, time for a change!

32:45.709 --> 32:48.457
Alright then, Elise is mine now.

32:48.619 --> 32:50.579
How about you, Joel,
who are you going for?

32:52.053 --> 32:53.638
Ah, I’ll go with whoever.

32:53.973 --> 32:54.986
So, what’s the plan?

32:55.011 --> 32:57.353
- Come on, let’s go ahead!
- I’m so excited.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.769
Enjoy!

33:00.717 --> 33:01.729
Don’t push me!

33:01.729 --> 33:04.107
Sorry. I’m just excited.

33:19.855 --> 33:22.608
Ina, Patrick beat me to it.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.086
Okay.

33:43.140 --> 33:44.409
Are you new here?

33:45.678 --> 33:47.263
Almost a month now.

33:48.897 --> 33:50.696
You’re prettier than the others.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.160
Hey, handsome, let's go!

33:58.831 --> 34:00.374
Come, over here!

34:03.124 --> 34:04.803
It seems fun in here. Come on!

34:05.324 --> 34:06.590
Take your robe off.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.248
Let's go.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.852
Come on. It looks fun in here.

34:35.101 --> 34:37.353
Have you tried this before?

34:38.284 --> 34:39.535
Tried what?

34:40.995 --> 34:43.539
The… extra service.

34:45.039 --> 34:46.082
What are you doing?

34:46.857 --> 34:48.025
Stop being so dramatic.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.925
I’ll make sure you
have a good time here.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.849
No, thanks. Maybe next time.

34:57.512 --> 34:58.638
Thank you.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.206
I’m not in the mood right now.

35:02.437 --> 35:03.563
Have you tried Ina before?

35:05.056 --> 35:06.182
Stop it!

35:09.649 --> 35:10.775
- Hey!
- What the heck?

35:10.966 --> 35:12.050
Hey Patrick!

35:12.276 --> 35:13.361
That's enough!

35:13.400 --> 35:15.193
Stay out of this, Joel!

35:16.405 --> 35:18.407
What's your problem?
Am I not paying you?

35:18.407 --> 35:19.867
- Stop it, bro.
- Hey!

35:20.493 --> 35:22.119
I said that's enough!

35:22.435 --> 35:23.445
Hey!

35:23.470 --> 35:25.890
You’re such a moron.
Why do you keep butting in?

35:25.915 --> 35:28.066
Well, you're crossing the line!

35:28.545 --> 35:32.507
That's what they are paid for!

35:32.681 --> 35:36.333
Paying us doesn’t mean
you can disrespect us!

35:36.551 --> 35:38.719
You’re being so dramatic!

35:38.761 --> 35:39.804
- Enough!
- Screw you!

35:39.804 --> 35:40.805
What the hell’s going on here?

35:40.830 --> 35:43.666
You should’ve asked the girl first
if she was okay with it!

35:43.724 --> 35:46.686
Get out of here, Joel!
Or do you want to watch more?

35:46.711 --> 35:49.330
- You piece of shit!
- I said, enough already!

35:49.355 --> 35:51.274
- Hey! Hey!
- Stop it!

35:52.812 --> 35:55.193
We don’t tolerate
fights here, gentlemen.

36:08.502 --> 36:10.377
You shouldn’t have interfered!

36:11.371 --> 36:13.450
What? What do you want?

36:14.323 --> 36:15.824
Should I just let
him disrespect you?

36:16.257 --> 36:17.383
Treat you like trash?

36:17.884 --> 36:21.579
Patrick's girlfriend even tells me
how much he hurts her physically!

36:22.138 --> 36:24.181
But that’s not your problem!

36:24.415 --> 36:27.168
You shouldn’t have gotten involved!
I’ll fight back if I have to!

36:27.312 --> 36:30.355
You think I can just watch
the woman important to me

36:30.913 --> 36:32.846
being treated like an object?

36:33.492 --> 36:35.766
Like she’s just something
to be paid for? Huh?

36:36.265 --> 36:37.265
That’s it!

36:37.844 --> 36:39.032
That’s my problem!

36:40.656 --> 36:43.135
I can’t stand seeing you
in another man’s arms.

36:43.659 --> 36:44.659
Why?

36:44.994 --> 36:49.415
If we get together, what do you think
people will think, or say about you?

36:49.584 --> 36:51.438
I don’t care what others think!

36:52.352 --> 36:53.489
No matter who she is!

36:54.620 --> 36:55.843
As long as I love her!

42:17.684 --> 42:19.034
You seemed different tonight.

42:20.486 --> 42:23.447
It’s just my way of thanking
you for defending me earlier.

42:25.378 --> 42:26.562
Ina, I love you.

43:08.582 --> 43:10.375
Hello? Who’s this?

43:10.731 --> 43:13.401
Ina, this is your dad.

43:14.845 --> 43:15.845
Dad?

43:38.785 --> 43:41.412
Can we please talk?

43:47.750 --> 43:49.835
Can we please talk?

43:54.631 --> 43:55.632
Dad?

43:55.657 --> 43:58.535
I’m sorry, Ina. I wasn't
able to get back to you.

43:59.147 --> 44:01.149
My partner left me too.

44:01.606 --> 44:03.775
I'm here in Hong Kong now, working.

44:14.318 --> 44:17.571
I love you, Ina.

44:20.158 --> 44:21.638
Please forgive me,

44:23.049 --> 44:24.229
I made a mistake.

44:26.117 --> 44:27.815
I’ve already talked to your mom.

44:29.075 --> 44:31.819
Whatever you and your mom need,

44:33.014 --> 44:34.014
I’ll make up for it.

44:35.067 --> 44:36.443
I’ll help you, Ina.

44:38.070 --> 44:39.071
Ina...

44:40.144 --> 44:41.145
I'll make it up to you.

44:42.401 --> 44:43.404
I'm sorry.

44:43.445 --> 44:46.581
Dad, I miss you so much.

45:30.936 --> 45:31.936
Bro!

45:32.121 --> 45:33.127
- What?
- If I were you,

45:33.152 --> 45:34.734
I’d just forget about what happened.

45:35.216 --> 45:37.506
You’re fighting
because of a woman?

45:38.329 --> 45:39.622
Stop that, bro!

45:39.795 --> 45:41.948
The three of us have
been together for so long.

45:42.778 --> 45:45.467
What I can’t understand
about that idiot is that...

45:45.981 --> 45:47.929
he’s actually serious
about that hooker.

45:48.888 --> 45:51.491
Not only that,
he even defended her.

45:53.580 --> 45:56.833
If I were you... I’d just let it go
and forgive each other.

45:57.404 --> 45:59.239
You’re both wrong
in this situation.

45:59.303 --> 46:00.529
You saw it yourself.

46:01.768 --> 46:03.595
He better not show
up in front of me,

46:04.288 --> 46:06.255
I might not be able
to control myself.

46:19.443 --> 46:20.652
Hey, let’s stay here.

46:23.540 --> 46:24.540
Give me a moment.

46:28.885 --> 46:29.928
Joel?

46:33.332 --> 46:34.666
Ah...

46:35.760 --> 46:36.761
Carla!

46:39.724 --> 46:41.563
Spa.

46:41.933 --> 46:45.228
I’m surprised you
still remember me.

46:46.707 --> 46:48.375
You still look great!

46:49.489 --> 46:50.491
How have you been?

46:50.516 --> 46:53.852
Same old. I’ve been
all over the place.

46:55.293 --> 46:57.753
Actually, I’m still
working at the spa.

46:58.700 --> 46:59.701
Ah...

47:01.139 --> 47:02.640
Are you by yourself?

47:06.907 --> 47:09.868
Is something going on?

47:12.901 --> 47:14.065
You know...

47:15.393 --> 47:18.050
Out of all the guests
I’ve had at the spa...

47:19.376 --> 47:22.243
you’re the one who
really stuck in my mind.

51:23.556 --> 51:25.196
You thought I was Joel, didn't you?

51:25.894 --> 51:27.222
Are you and Joel together?

51:27.653 --> 51:29.215
Do you two have a relationship?

51:29.807 --> 51:31.892
Joel and I don’t
have a relationship.

51:32.871 --> 51:34.873
Don’t waste your time on him.

51:35.173 --> 51:37.217
You don’t deserve
a player like him.

51:37.450 --> 51:39.418
Why are you talking
badly about your friend?

51:40.046 --> 51:41.960
Would you like to
have sex with me?

51:43.154 --> 51:44.781
I'll give you three thousand pesos.

51:45.140 --> 51:50.353
Sir, that’s not allowed here,
and I don’t do that.

51:51.029 --> 51:55.526
Joel’s courting you because we made
a bet that he could get you to say yes.

51:56.444 --> 52:00.365
That’s why he’s being extra with
his courting and showing concern.

52:00.829 --> 52:03.206
That’s all it is.
It’s just a challenge.

52:03.537 --> 52:04.621
A challenge?

52:04.911 --> 52:07.539
Yeah, it’s just a challenge.
You heard everything.

52:09.592 --> 52:10.774
Give me a moment.

52:46.746 --> 52:47.747
Give it to me.

52:48.331 --> 52:49.749
So you’re okay
with it after all!

56:11.993 --> 56:13.203
[knocking on door]

56:18.395 --> 56:19.855
- Joel.
- Ina?

56:26.538 --> 56:27.997
- Hi, Ina!
- Ina.

56:28.142 --> 56:29.227
Carla?

56:29.449 --> 56:30.523
Ina, sorry.

56:32.555 --> 56:33.587
I'm sorry, Ina.

56:33.612 --> 56:34.821
Hold on. I'm sorry.

56:34.846 --> 56:36.389
Please, let me explain.

56:36.527 --> 56:37.695
I’m drunk.

56:38.221 --> 56:39.437
I didn’t mean to.

56:39.938 --> 56:41.481
I just got carried away.

56:41.982 --> 56:43.400
You know, my Mom was right.

56:43.531 --> 56:45.087
You’re all the same!

56:45.654 --> 56:48.032
Wait, hold on! Wait.

56:48.655 --> 56:50.907
I did everything for you.

56:51.616 --> 56:53.701
But it feels like
I don’t matter.

56:57.914 --> 56:58.914
Ina?

56:59.749 --> 57:00.749
Ina?

57:08.826 --> 57:10.578
Enjoy your meal.

57:25.787 --> 57:27.021
What would you
like to order, sir?

57:28.192 --> 57:30.569
Ah, well, nothing.

57:31.494 --> 57:33.204
I just came by to...

57:35.455 --> 57:36.706
give this to you.

57:38.176 --> 57:41.045
Sir, just call me if
you want to order.

57:42.048 --> 57:45.885
You look prettier
without too much makeup.

57:46.227 --> 57:49.564
You’re simpler,
and you’re prettier.

57:49.994 --> 57:50.994
Ina.

57:52.200 --> 57:53.440
Can we talk?

57:56.011 --> 57:57.513
Please, leave.

57:57.538 --> 57:59.248
I might get told
off by my manager.

57:59.547 --> 58:00.547
Ina?

58:01.577 --> 58:02.743
I’m really sorry.

58:03.716 --> 58:07.678
Sorry for what I did. Forgive me.

58:08.905 --> 58:10.746
Come back later at five.

58:23.366 --> 58:24.617
Tetay, you can go ahead.

58:24.642 --> 58:26.185
- Alright. Take care.
- Bye!

58:26.852 --> 58:27.852
Ina.

58:34.276 --> 58:35.653
So, there was a challenge?

58:35.945 --> 58:37.613
You guys made a bet on me?

58:38.489 --> 58:41.033
Ina, please forgive me.

58:42.034 --> 58:44.787
We did bet on you, but
I’m serious about you now.

58:46.122 --> 58:48.249
What I feel for you is real, Ina.

58:50.835 --> 58:53.963
I want you to know that something
happened between me and Patrick at the spa.

59:01.679 --> 59:02.722
I'll admit it!

59:03.764 --> 59:07.435
I made a mistake
accepting Patrick's offer.

59:11.591 --> 59:16.263
I’m so angry at myself for
accepting it and that I did it!

59:20.590 --> 59:22.884
But you know what I told myself?

59:24.209 --> 59:26.545
I will never do that again.

59:28.664 --> 59:31.690
Not for you, but for myself!

59:34.151 --> 59:35.587
I’m sorry.

59:35.921 --> 59:36.921
Ina?

59:38.289 --> 59:39.289
Ina?

01:00:25.166 --> 01:00:26.639
[phone rings]

01:00:33.519 --> 01:00:37.695
- Hello?
- Bro, turn on the TV to the news!

01:00:37.745 --> 01:00:38.745
Huh?

01:00:39.137 --> 01:00:40.137
Hold on.

01:00:49.442 --> 01:00:50.819
- Go over here! Here!
- Breaking News!

01:00:50.844 --> 01:00:53.179
- Go over here! Here!
- A spa offering extra service

01:00:53.204 --> 01:00:55.004
- Open that!
- were raided by the authorities.

01:01:00.338 --> 01:01:01.338
Shit!

01:01:01.795 --> 01:01:02.795
Shit!

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:12.141
Sir, please don’t do this to us.

01:01:12.963 --> 01:01:15.924
If no one reported it,
we wouldn’t be here.

01:01:26.239 --> 01:01:28.658
What they're saying is not true.

01:01:32.075 --> 01:01:34.778
Joel. Joel... Joel!

01:01:34.918 --> 01:01:37.740
Ina! Come on, hurry up!

01:01:38.353 --> 01:01:39.586
...that’s why we’re here.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.828
Those are just speculations.

01:01:52.892 --> 01:01:53.893
Thank you!

01:01:55.769 --> 01:01:56.769
Huh?

01:01:57.605 --> 01:01:58.605
What was that?

01:02:01.909 --> 01:02:03.295
I said thank you.

01:02:09.617 --> 01:02:10.617
Ina!

01:02:11.201 --> 01:02:12.201
I’m sorry!

01:02:46.153 --> 01:02:50.282
You know, I saw Patrick outside
earlier when we were leaving the spa.

01:02:50.574 --> 01:02:51.574
Huh?

01:02:52.284 --> 01:02:53.284
Patrick?

01:02:54.178 --> 01:02:55.178
Hmm-hmm.

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:03.906
Ah, Joel, I owe you so much.

01:03:04.297 --> 01:03:06.758
But don’t worry,
I’ll make it up to you.

01:03:07.039 --> 01:03:08.039
And...

01:03:09.194 --> 01:03:10.446
Sorry for everything.

01:03:11.011 --> 01:03:12.011
Ina.

01:03:12.619 --> 01:03:14.198
Sorry for everything
I've done wrong

01:03:15.523 --> 01:03:16.617
I didn’t mean to.

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:18.352
About Carla...

01:03:20.479 --> 01:03:22.606
Ina, she doesn’t matter to me.

01:03:23.732 --> 01:03:25.234
I was just pushed into it.

01:03:26.944 --> 01:03:27.944
I’m sorry.

01:03:28.344 --> 01:03:29.512
Forget about it.

01:03:29.989 --> 01:03:33.200
What’s important is that
we’ve forgiven each other.

01:03:34.334 --> 01:03:36.837
Besides, I'm planning
to leave the spa.

01:03:37.454 --> 01:03:39.873
I’ll just focus on being
a full-time waitress.

01:03:40.628 --> 01:03:42.047
That’s better.

01:03:42.835 --> 01:03:43.877
Much better.

01:03:44.461 --> 01:03:47.006
And you could
take a short course

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:48.558
while you’re waiting tables.

01:03:49.067 --> 01:03:50.068
In TESDA.

01:03:50.759 --> 01:03:52.636
They offer a lot of
training programs.

01:03:53.417 --> 01:03:58.027
They also have... what’s it called?
A professional massage therapist course.

01:03:58.767 --> 01:03:59.810
They have that.

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:03.104
Ina.

01:04:05.691 --> 01:04:07.151
Can I count on something?

01:04:08.135 --> 01:04:11.362
Joel, I’ll admit it to you.

01:04:12.408 --> 01:04:13.743
I’ve fallen for you.

01:04:16.559 --> 01:04:22.503
But let’s give each other space to think.

01:04:23.873 --> 01:04:25.750
Give me some space.

01:04:40.312 --> 01:04:42.801
- You have energy, huh? You’ve got energy!
- Hey you!

01:04:42.826 --> 01:04:44.146
- Look at my fit!
- Hey!

01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:45.749
You’re the one who
had the spa raided!

01:04:45.989 --> 01:04:46.989
Damn!

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:48.484
That’s right, it was me, Joel!

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:51.382
You’re not taking
our bet seriously!

01:04:51.528 --> 01:04:53.614
You’re putting too much into Ina.

01:04:53.822 --> 01:04:56.909
What’s your life gonna be
like with her, Joel? Tell me!

01:04:57.055 --> 01:04:59.189
Ina’s just a low-class woman!

01:04:59.235 --> 01:05:00.654
- What did you say?
- Calm down, bro!

01:05:00.679 --> 01:05:02.347
Why? What will you do?

01:05:02.372 --> 01:05:04.541
- Are you gonna fight me?
- We’re just concerned about you, bro.

01:05:04.566 --> 01:05:06.713
Don’t stop me!

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.882
And don’t interfere with
my decisions and feelings!

01:05:11.296 --> 01:05:12.714
I love Ina!

01:05:13.008 --> 01:05:15.094
No matter what kind of woman she is!

01:05:17.751 --> 01:05:19.503
By the way, I’m thanking you.

01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:24.643
Because of you, Ina will
leave the spa. Damn you!

01:05:24.905 --> 01:05:25.990
Screw you!

01:05:26.551 --> 01:05:27.636
Stop it, bro.

01:05:30.171 --> 01:05:31.414
Don’t come back here!

01:05:39.926 --> 01:05:46.725
Effleurage or gliding is a gentle,
or light pressure stroke

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:50.881
used at the start and
end of a massage.

01:05:50.906 --> 01:05:53.200
This is what we’ll do first.

01:05:53.507 --> 01:05:55.509
We’ll put oil on our hands.

01:05:55.637 --> 01:05:58.820
...the muscle and
apply oil to the body.

01:05:59.471 --> 01:06:02.432
They can also request to add…

01:06:02.457 --> 01:06:05.378
...if they want to feel
more comfortable.

01:06:05.477 --> 01:06:11.191
Then, at the lower part,
we’ll glide upwards.

01:06:12.169 --> 01:06:13.289
Then down...

01:06:13.772 --> 01:06:16.733
Also, do it like this.

01:06:21.702 --> 01:06:23.787
Here are your orders.

01:06:24.037 --> 01:06:26.210
Thank you.
Enjoy you meal.

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:27.890
Thank you.

01:06:28.677 --> 01:06:32.306
That'll be three tapsilog and
three lemonades. Okay, thank you.

01:06:32.504 --> 01:06:33.504
Yes, sir?

01:06:36.466 --> 01:06:38.853
Ah, thank you!

01:07:05.824 --> 01:07:06.866
Good morning, sir!

01:07:06.906 --> 01:07:07.906
Good morning.

01:07:16.006 --> 01:07:17.216
I’ll take care of it here.

01:07:17.241 --> 01:07:18.241
Alright.

01:07:19.962 --> 01:07:21.025
Good morning, sir.

01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.262
Good morning.

01:07:22.677 --> 01:07:26.222
Uhm... What service
do you recommend?

01:07:27.542 --> 01:07:31.921
This one, sir. The combination of
Thai-Swedish, which includes sauna.

01:07:31.968 --> 01:07:32.969
Hmm.

01:07:34.441 --> 01:07:35.859
Can I make a request?

01:07:35.917 --> 01:07:38.253
Yes, sir! What would you like?

01:07:38.384 --> 01:07:39.635
Uhm...

01:07:41.404 --> 01:07:42.632
Do you mind…

01:07:43.507 --> 01:07:46.802
giving me the massage yourself?
Is that okay?

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:50.624
Sorry, sir. I’m not a
massage therapist anymore.

01:07:50.791 --> 01:07:52.918
I’m now the manager here.

01:07:53.014 --> 01:07:56.101
But I’ll give you the
best therapist we have.

01:07:56.511 --> 01:07:57.852
That’s unfortunate.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:00.259
I have company, though.

01:08:00.759 --> 01:08:01.759
Hmm?

01:08:01.843 --> 01:08:02.843
Yeah.

01:08:02.994 --> 01:08:04.279
Where’s Joel?

01:08:04.411 --> 01:08:05.829
He’s right here.

01:08:05.854 --> 01:08:07.891
Oh, you’re here.
You left us there.

01:08:07.916 --> 01:08:09.376
Bro, Ina’s here.

01:08:09.914 --> 01:08:12.041
Hi, Ina! How are you?

01:08:12.813 --> 01:08:14.690
Ahem. Hi, Ina.

01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:22.692
I want to start by apologizing
for everything I did wrong.

01:08:24.658 --> 01:08:25.826
Are you two okay now?

01:08:26.334 --> 01:08:29.295
Ina? It’s been years.

01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:33.551
Wounds heal, and
forgiveness comes.

01:08:34.267 --> 01:08:36.937
It’s different when
it’s your bro, right?

01:08:36.962 --> 01:08:39.798
- We're rock solid!
- For life, bro!

01:08:39.881 --> 01:08:43.304
Until the plane flies!

01:08:44.337 --> 01:08:45.862
You haven't changed at all.

01:08:45.887 --> 01:08:47.556
[all laughing]

01:08:48.849 --> 01:08:51.059
So, are you getting a massage?

01:08:51.435 --> 01:08:53.645
But there’s no
extra service here.

01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:55.414
- What do you think?
- Of course!

01:08:55.439 --> 01:08:57.524
- That's what we like!
- Let’s go!

01:08:57.524 --> 01:08:59.026
Let’s go!

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:28.680
Yeah! Oh, that feels good!

01:09:29.681 --> 01:09:30.849
That’s great!

01:09:32.934 --> 01:09:34.144
Does that feel good?

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:37.772
Ina?

01:09:42.361 --> 01:09:43.361
Have a seat.

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:48.616
Ina.

01:09:49.868 --> 01:09:53.121
I’ll say this over and over,
like I’ve always told you.

01:09:53.497 --> 01:09:58.168
Ina, I love you so much.

01:10:02.172 --> 01:10:04.925
And I’ll keep saying it.

01:10:05.675 --> 01:10:08.053
Sorry for everything I’ve done.

01:10:09.304 --> 01:10:12.265
I love you so so much!

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.384
Oh! Wait a second.

01:10:15.031 --> 01:10:16.908
I’m gonna get something.
Just stay here.

01:10:20.044 --> 01:10:21.421
Don’t look!

01:10:22.854 --> 01:10:23.855
Should I close my eyes?

01:10:23.895 --> 01:10:25.313
Yes, close them.

01:10:25.356 --> 01:10:26.356
Okay.

01:10:30.183 --> 01:10:31.560
Just close your eyes.

01:10:32.659 --> 01:10:34.077
Open your eyes.

01:10:36.431 --> 01:10:37.765
Will you be my wife?

01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:44.821
Do you want to?

01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:53.266
Will you be my husband?

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.220
Yes!

01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:58.117
Of course!

01:11:00.062 --> 01:11:01.260
Will it fit?

01:11:01.285 --> 01:11:03.203
No. Here, in this one.

01:11:03.228 --> 01:11:05.268
- That’s it!
- There you go!

01:15:26.663 --> 01:15:29.624
[both laughing]
