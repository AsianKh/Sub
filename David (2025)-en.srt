1
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,137
Oh boy.

2
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:38,057
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy,
oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

3
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,350
Ha ha!

4
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,935
It's time!

5
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,605
Stand aside, stand aside,
Gibor! Ha ha!

6
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,648
Thank you, Abirra.
Thank you, Yala.

7
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,322
Oh! Hey, hey, hey, Shira.

8
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,032
Don't worry, I got you.

9
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,408
You're a bit early,
aren't you girl?

10
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,368
Stand back, everyone.

11
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:00,330
The flock's about to
get a little bigger.

12
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:03,708
It's okay girl, you're good.

13
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,543
Just breathe.

14
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,462
We'll get this little one out,

15
00:02:07,587 --> 00:02:08,963
then I promise...

16
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,677
I'll bring you home.

17
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:22,560
Stay together.

18
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:25,145
If we stay close, stay tight,

19
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,733
it won't be able to
single anyone out.

20
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:33,613
I can't do this alone.

21
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:38,242
No, wait!

22
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:00,097
Just stay quiet girl.

23
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:02,392
He hasn't seen you.

24
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:07,897
That's it.

25
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:10,233
Eyes on me.

26
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:12,652
On...

27
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,320
Me.

28
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:19,658
No, no, no, no!

29
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:21,493
No!

30
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,417
No!

31
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,218
God spoke to me.

32
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:41,597
Eh, it comes with
being a prophet.

33
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,598
Oh!

34
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,602
He told me very clearly

35
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:49,230
that I was to come to
this very house

36
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,857
and anoint a son of Jesse

37
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,987
to be the next king.

38
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:01,283
But

39
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,077
it is none of these.

40
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,750
That one had potential
though.

41
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:17,425
Unless, perhaps you
have another son?

42
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,727
Oh, no.

43
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:28,687
Shira.

44
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:30,647
Shira!

45
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,023
No!

46
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,697
Shira.

47
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:41,865
I'm so sorry.

48
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,082
Huh? What?

49
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,167
Shira?

50
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,043
Shira, you're alive?!

51
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,422
Oh.

52
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,723
Oh, ho, ho!

53
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,060
That'll teach you to
mess with my sheep.

54
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,018
Whoo!

55
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,898
I'm so glad you're okay.

56
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,150
And who is this little one?

57
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,447
Oh. Oh, she's my lamb, is she?

58
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:23,742
Tali.

59
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:25,158
Well, Tali.

60
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,953
Let's go and introduce you to
the others and get you home.

61
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,918
Wait here, girl.

62
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,907
Whew.

63
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,750
Whooo! Ha ha.

64
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,043
Now, where are the others?

65
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:28,055
Hey! Hey, it's okay,
he's gone, you're safe.

66
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,557
You can come out now.

67
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,893
Don't you want to come out?

68
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,562
Meet the new baby?

69
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,152
I know that was scary,

70
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:44,072
but doesn't it make you
feel more alive?

71
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:45,532
And do you know what?

72
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:47,617
I don't see a bunch of
scared sheep.

73
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:48,952
Do you know what I see?

74
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:52,580
Mighty horses! Ready
to take on the world!

75
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,168
I'm scared too sometimes,

76
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,630

David!

we get a goat?

00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,027
Huh?

Hmm.

00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,242
Er. Sh-Shalom.

137
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,410
It- It wasn't me.

138
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:21,497
And if it was, I can explain.

139
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:22,790
Maybe.

140
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,458
Uh, what's happening?

141
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,168
Remember when I told you
God had big plans for you?

142
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:31,298
Well, they may have been
bigger than even I thought.

143
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,925
David,

144
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,218
son of Jesse.

145
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:39,515
Are you ready for a
great adventure?

146
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:41,725
Uh, yes!

147
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,312
As King of Israel.

148
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:45,772
What? No.

149
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:46,605
No?

150
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,398
No, no, no, no.

151
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,777
Don't mess this up
for me, David.

152
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:54,363
If you're king, then I
get to be a princess.

153
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,823
I can't be king.

154
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,075
We already have a king.

155
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,618
That's right.

156
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,578
Which makes this treason.

157
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:05,123
Oh, now it's treason?

158
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,210
And, uh, what was it when
he was considering you?

159
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,588
Ugh, I am a soldier
in Saul's army!

160
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,342
I have been nothing but
faithful to my father,

161
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,510
King Saul, and God!

162
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,803
That is wonderful.

163
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,430
Continue to do so.

164
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:22,600
You can't take the youngest

165
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:25,227
and elevate him above
the rest of us!

166
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,937
Do you want me to take his place

167
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,772
and shepherd the flock again?

168
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,692
No, Ozem will take
over shepherding.

169
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,027
Wait, what?

170
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:35,070
No. Nethanel can do it.

171
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:36,905
I'm not doing it.

172
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,240
The twins can do it.

173
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,783
- Don't bring us into this.
- Yeah.

174
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:40,827
- Boys.
- Whatever.

175
00:11:40,952 --> 00:11:43,328
Don't look at me.

176
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,915
- Way to go.
- Way to go, David.

177
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,167
Boys.

178
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:51,670
Sorry.

179
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,880
I like it. Do it again.

180
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:57,383
I do not come here lightly.

181
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,305
The very hearts of the
people are at stake.

182
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,100
There is the darkness
over the land.

183
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,352
Philistines?

184
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:09,105
The Philistines are
a threat, to be sure.

185
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:14,402
They lord over us with
power and pride.

186
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:19,072
But there is a graver
danger we face.

187
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,575
Amalekites?

188
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,868
The Amalekites are
nothing but scavengers.

189
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,788
And they are always watching,

190
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,625
always waiting in the shadows.

191
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,130
Just as they preyed on
the weak and vulnerable

192
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:36,132
when we escaped Pharaoh,

193
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:39,927
they wait for us to be divided,

194
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,180
for the sheep to scatter

195
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:47,183
and they will strike once more.

196
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:55,108
But our true battle is not
against flesh and blood,

197
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,068
but in our hearts.

198
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,322
Did our enemies make
us turn away from God?

199
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,575
No. We demanded a king.

200
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:07,370
So, God gave us King Saul

201
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:11,125
whose love of the crown
has consumed him.

202
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,585
And now, we see the cost

203
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,422
of putting our faith in man.

204
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:20,300
Philistines, Amalekites,

205
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:21,843
Saul.

206
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:25,347
We are hard pressed
on every side.

207
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:28,475
But at last,

208
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,603
God has chosen another.

209
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,815
Someone with a heart after His.

210
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,360
But I don't want to be king.

211
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:42,615
That is surprisingly
good criteria for a king.

212
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm just a shepherd.

213
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:47,160
The people are lost, David.

214
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,747
Astray in a storm.

215
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,625
A shepherd

216
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,585
is precisely who they need.

217
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,838
But God is my shepherd.
He's who we need.

218
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,840
Every excuse you give

219
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:04,177
is another reason it
must be you.

220
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,555
But...
Yes?

221
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:21,195
Stand before me, son of Jesse.

So, what happens now?

231
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,408
Do Saul and David
fight to the death?

232
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,035
No. No.

233
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,288
This is a gift that must
remain secret.

234
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,668
We have heard
about David's gift.

235
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,087
He must come before
King Saul at once.

236
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,422
They couldn't have known.

237
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,217
What have you brought
on our house?

238
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:08,093
They cannot know I'm here.

239
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,430
If Saul finds out about this,
none of you will be safe.

240
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:12,263
Zeruiah, no!

241
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,098
Who goes there?

242
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,018
It is I, Princess Zeruiah.

243
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,980
Hmph, is David here?

244
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,233
Get out of here.
We'll distract him.

245
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:25,985
Sh- Shalom.

246
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:28,280
King Saul is greatly
disturbed.

247
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,115
David must come with me at once.

248
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,702
L- L- Look, David is-

249
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,118
Here.

250
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,455
I'm right here.

251
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,290
Oh, dear boy.

252
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,377
He is going to eat you alive.

253
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,773
Welcome to Gibeah.

254
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:03,607
Hey, you.

255
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:04,900
Strawberries!

256
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,568
Get your fresh picked
strawberries here!

257
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,572
Get your fresh fruit here!

258
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,078
Here we go.

259
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,578
On the count of three.
- Come on.

260
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:20,207
Get some more tension
into that line, boys!

261
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:21,040
All right.

262
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:22,708
Finally, you're here!

263
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:31,885
Where
do you want this one?

264
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,887
Just
like that. Good, good.

265
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:42,728
Woo-hoo-hoo!

266
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,733
This is the one from
Bethlehem, Your Grace.

267
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,070
Where is your instrument?

268
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:53,072
Er, instrument?

269
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,200
You can't exactly play
for my husband

270
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,202
without an instrument.

271
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,078
Play?

272
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,580
And you can't go before
him like this.

273
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,082
What's in your hair?

274
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,042
Oil?

275
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,463
Uh. Whoa.

276
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:11,300
Whoo!

277
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,178
Sorry.

278
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,013
Oh, not at all.

279
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,517
In fact, here, why don't
you stand in front of me?

280
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:21,560
Oh, okay.

281
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,230
Wait a second.

282
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,482
Where do you think
you are going?

283
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:27,648
Prince Jonathan,

284
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,485
we really must see your
father quite urgently.

285
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,403
Now's really not
the best time.

286
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,323
The affairs of state
cannot be put on hold

287
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,742
while you pacify your father's-

288
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,243
Do you think
this is helping me?!

289
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,290
We'll put the affairs
of state on hold now.

290
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,958
Clearly it's not
the best time.

291
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,377
What's going on?

292
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:50,672
Saul called for every
musician in the kingdom.

293
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:51,965
Music used to soothe him.

294
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,593
Get out,
and don't come back!

295
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,972
Yes, Your Highness.

296
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:00,140
Ah, why don't you
take my place?

297
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,850
Oh, please. In front of me.

298
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,393
No, I insist. Take my place.

299
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,603
- Don't let me get in your way.
- Up to the front.

300
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:09,692
Ah.

301
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,362
Hey, kid.

302
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,322
What are you doing here?

303
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,113
Next!

304
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,245
I guess it's your turn.

305
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,360
Shhhh...

306
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:02,410
They think a child can help me?

307
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,917
Are you going to sing, or what?

308
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,752
Well I... I don't have my...

309
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:13,755
If I could just...

310
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,923
Get out!

311
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,098
Next.

312
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,058
No, wait!

313
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,228
Can I borrow this? Thank you.

314
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,482
You're going
back in there?

315
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:33,942
I know right?

316
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,953
Huh? Why are you back here?

317
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,498
Because now I've got this.

318
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,043
Just leave me in peace.

319
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:53,837

What's your name?

348
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,883
David.

349
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,678
Well David, I can't remember

350
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,223
the last time I felt
like that...

351
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,475
Free.

352
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:00,232
You know, I never
asked for this.

353
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:01,692
I didn't want to be king.

354
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:02,817
Me neither.

355
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:05,945
I mean, I can imagine.

356
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,240
Can you, David?

357
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:11,743
One minute you're tending
your father's donkeys,

358
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:15,955
the next Samuel anoints
you to be king of Israel.

359
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:23,380
And then, after all these years,

360
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,757
after all I've done
for Israel...

361
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:32,555
he tries to- to take it from me,

362
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,598
says he's going to
give it to another.

363
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,145
If I get my hands
on that prophet.

364
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:44,192
If I find out who it is Samuel
has chosen to replace me...

365
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,533
But then you came along.

366
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:57,872
Father, the Philistines.
The Philistines amass for war.

367
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:02,377
Today is a bad day for
them to pick a fight.

368
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,295
Ready my horse.

369
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,465
David, you have done your
king a great service.

370
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,967
Return to your fields.

371
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:12,012
And while you're there, write
a victory song for my return.

372
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,445
This is not what I
signed up for.

373
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:31,990
So this is not going
to end well.

374
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:33,115
Come on men.

375
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:37,662
Spirits up, you are mighty
soldiers in the Israelite army.

376
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,663
If by mighty you mean scared

377
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,208
and by soldiers you mean
farmers, then sure, that's us.

378
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:45,587
You underestimate
who's on our side.

379
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,380
Do you see this, Jonathan?

380
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,590
We haven't even faced
the Philistines yet.

381
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,510
I did this to myself, with this.

382
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,053
It's not even a real weapon.

383
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,555
- Ow.
- I am so sorry. Are you okay?

384
00:25:56,682 --> 00:25:59,683
- Yup, we're dead.
- Have a little faith men.

385
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:04,730
Oh I do have a little
faith, very little.

386
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,145
Saul, Saul, Saul.

387
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,523
I thought we had an agreement.

388
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,692
I allow you and
your little tribes

389
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,443
to live in this land and you-

390
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,447
I know our agreement Achish.

391
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:54,697
We pay your taxes,

392
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,908
we get our tools sharpened
by your blacksmiths.

393
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:00,037
Well I must say,
a lot of your tools

394
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:01,997
are looking very pointy.

395
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:04,373
That was not part of
our arrangement.

396
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:07,627
Well, perhaps it's time
to come to new terms.

397
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:11,505
Ooh, those are fighting
words Saul.

398
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,257
Your army is clearly

399
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,467
no match for mine.

400
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,802
I would rather not
kill all those

401
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:18,638
potential workers for my fields,

402
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,848
so why don't we make
this simpler?

403
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:25,728
Your best warrior, against mine?

404
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:29,523
Father, you're more than
a match for any Philistine.

405
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,152
Besides, God fights for us.

406
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,738
So be it.

407
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,990
Choose your man to fight,
Achish.

408
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,325
Good.

409
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,578
Very good. Very, very,
very good.

410
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:43,913
Deal.

411
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:46,123
Bring out Goliath.

412
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:11,023
He's huge.

413
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:14,985
Oh, that's not him.
That's his armor bearer.

414
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,627
- He's huge.
- Like a mountain.

415
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,753
He's the biggest thing
I've ever seen,

416
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,297
and I once seen a whale.

417
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,635
I like horses.

418
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:27,017
Not much else will
fill me up.

419
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:45,577
This day, Goliath defies
the ranks of Israel.

420
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,953
Choose a man to fight me.

421
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:53,793
If he wins, the Philistines
will be your subjects.

422
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:59,132
If I beat him,
you will serve us.

423
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:04,178
Summon my advisors.

424
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:12,812
Don't worry, take your time.

425
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:15,565
Goliath is nothing if not...

426
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:17,233
patient.

427
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,047
Shimea get an Ephah of grain.

428
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:40,548
What's an Ephah?

429
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,467
Ozem, the sheep.

430
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,103
Ima, Ima, look.

431
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:55,938
Yes, dear. It's beautiful.

432
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,567
Hmm, stress weaving again?

433
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:01,152
I'm allowed.

434
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,822
Eliab and Abinadab have
been called to war,

435
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:05,490
I still don't know what
happening with...

436
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:07,742
David.

437
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:08,702
David!

438
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:12,080
Oh yay. Ow.

439
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:16,250
Oh, I missed you guys.

440
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,587
Are you king yet?
Do you have a crown?

441
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:21,297
Can I wear it?

442
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:23,842
No.

443
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:24,800
David.

444
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,928
It's a relief to see
you in one piece.

445
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:27,803
Are you all right?

446
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,013
Did he find out about
the anointing?

447
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,765
Have you eaten?

448
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,058
Is the family in danger?

449
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,643
They touched
your hair.

450
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,353
What happened with Saul?

451
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,022
Nothing happened.

452
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:40,190
What's going on here?

453
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:43,820
Well, the town has been
asked for supplies for the war.

454
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:46,780
Where are the supplies?

455
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,282
I got hungry.

456
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,160
From the house to the donkey?

457
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,832
Huh-uh-uh. Where do
you think you're going?

458
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,458
You haven't told me what
happened yet.

459
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,295
Nothing, it's all okay.

460
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,422
I just want to head
back to the fields.

461
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:04,840
Saul was troubled and
I played for him,

462
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,175
that's all.

463
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:18,855
I just... The whole
time I was in Gibeah,

464
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,230
nothing made sense.

465
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:22,817
Am I meant to lie?

466
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:27,988
Am I meant to help Saul,
or hate him,

467
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,157
or obey him, or fight him?

468
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,453
I just don't know!

469
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,498
Things are simple out there.

470
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,877
Everything makes sense.

471
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:45,757
But with the anointing,
with the king thing...

472
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:50,302
I just don't
understand what God's doing.

473
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:52,138
Nor do I.

474
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,098
And that's why I do this.

475
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,018
Stress-weaving again?

476
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:58,812
That's not the point.

477
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:02,357
Look here. Beautiful isn't it?

478
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,152
Um, it's not your best.

479
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:09,238
Every thread
has a purpose.

480
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,865
They all have a place.

481
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,533
It looks messy, but when
you see the finished picture

482
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,912
on the other side,
they all make sense.

483
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,915
You're just like one
of these threads.

484
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:21,833
Am even I there?

485
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:26,630
Yup, here you are
and there's Tali.

486
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,925
Yes Ozem, even you.

487
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,468
Uh, Ima.

488
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,720
I love you.

489
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,013
Ima!

490
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:38,977
Hey let me see.

491
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,270
Nope, it's not finished yet.

492
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:43,605
Play me something.

493
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:44,982
But...

494
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,733

What are you two singing for?

555
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:24,327
There is carrying to be done.

556
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:27,120
Someone needs to take
our supplies to the army.

557
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:31,625
They wouldn't arrive with
Nethanel, perhaps Ozem?

558
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:37,213
I know who can take it, right?

559
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:51,895
Here, look after Tali
for me won't you?

560
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,067
Right.

561
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,570
Wait, where's David going?

562
00:38:09,747 --> 00:38:12,123
Fresh supplies over here.

563
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:18,005
Hey kid, over here!

564
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,717
I laugh
while you cower.

565
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:22,593
Where are you going?

566
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,888
Excuse me.

567
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,182
David!

568
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:30,810
What are you doing here?

569
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:33,145
I brought cheese and bread.

570
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,022
Ooh, and figs.

571
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:38,192
I defeat you
without lifting a finger.

572
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,195
Who's doing all the shouting?

573
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,488
You are putting the
whole family in danger

574
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,117
by being here to what?
Watch a battle?

575
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:49,370
Oh calm down Eliab,
who wouldn't want to see

576
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:52,457
the glorious Israelite
army in action?

577
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:55,083
You are an
army of cowards.

578
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,045
- He's not wrong.
- Fair point, fair point.

579
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,090
Not even your
God can save you

580
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:03,050
from the might of
the Philistines.

581
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,803
Oh yeah? Come over here
and we'll see about that.

582
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:07,930
Sh-sh-shhh,
Goliath might hear you.

583
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,223
Who's Goliath?

584
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:13,477
Imagine the biggest
warrior you have ever seen.

585
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:14,478
Okay?

586
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:16,647
Now imagine somebody ate him.

587
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,857
It doesn't matter
how big he is.

588
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:22,737
With God on our side,
even I could fight him.

589
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:23,987
- You?
- Yes.

590
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:28,325
He thinks he can
beat Goliath!

591
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:33,455
With God fighting for us it
could be you, or you, or you.

592
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,917
Me?

593
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,838
Well, looks
like it's going to be you.

594
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,470
I cannot wait to
see who you send to face me.

595
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:49,222
What about our new
treaty proposal?

596
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:51,557
Sire, with all due respect,

597
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:54,477
King Achish knows he
has the upper hand.

598
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,437
He will not be interested
in a new treaty.

599
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:58,147
Yes, but was it presented
to him?

600
00:39:58,272 --> 00:39:59,148
What did he say?

601
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:02,025
He said,
"I have the upper hand,

602
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,943
and I am not interested
in a new treaty."

603
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,405
Father, we're out of options.

604
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,782
I will go and fight him.

605
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:10,827
I will not send my son
on a suicide mission.

606
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:14,372
This Philistine is no
match for the God of Israel.

607
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:15,538
I said no!

608
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,418
You again?

609
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:22,420
A song can do little here, boy.

610
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:23,713
I haven't come to sing.

611
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,008
Then why are you here?

612
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,427
I- I will fight Goliath.

613
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,018
I'm serious.
I will fight Goliath.

614
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:41,398
Ah David. Once again you
have lightened my spirits.

615
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,650
Your presence here
is most welcome.

616
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,568
You're so small.

617
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,905
What difference does
size make to a giant?

618
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,448
I will rip him
limb from limb-

619
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,577
You're not afraid to
go out there alone?

620
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:53,910
I won't be alone.

621
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,913
Oh this is ridiculous.
Just look at him.

622
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,040
Yeah, look at me.

623
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:02,587
I've fought lions and bears, Me!

624
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:05,755
God protected me when they
came for my father's sheep,

625
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:08,467
and He will do the same
against Goliath.

626
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:13,097
And I saw him tame one other
beast when no others could.

627
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:17,727
Is that what I've
become, a beast?

628
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:22,022
I know who you really are.

629
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:26,360
The one God chose
to lead His people.

630
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,903
I know you still recognize
His voice.

631
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:31,448
What is it telling you?

632
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,453
Sire, you cannot
be considering...

633
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,788
Suit him up.

634
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,543
But sire...

635
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:45,295
Or you could go,
if you want?

636
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,922
Get him ready.

637
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,135
I defeat you without-

638
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,762
Is that really
necessary? Okay.

639
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:56,265
Today we will see if God
is still with us...

640
00:41:58,475 --> 00:41:59,477
Or not.

641
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,353
I can't go out in this.

642
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,148
You're right, there
are still too many gaps.

643
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,483
Here, here, and here.

644
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:11,780
Much better.

645
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:14,032
Yes, but can he move?

646
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,867
Of course he can.

647
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:17,912
You can, can't you?

648
00:42:19,372 --> 00:42:20,413
David?

649
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,625
Oh dear.

650
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,878
Who's it going
to be, Saul?

651
00:42:58,952 --> 00:42:59,953
Huh.

652
00:43:23,977 --> 00:43:29,065
♪ I will not be afraid... ♪

653
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,322
Uh-oh.

654
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:38,283
David, you fool.

655
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:11,233
Silence.

656
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,083
Uh, where are you going?

657
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,420
This is an insult.

658
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,798
Yes, a great insult.

659
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:37,508
An insult you should crush.

660
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:41,972
A child? You expect me
to fight a child?

661
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:44,975
No. No no no no.

662
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,895
No, no way. No, of course not.

663
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,233
But yes, that's exactly
what I expect you to do.

664
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,695
Do you think this is a game?

665
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:06,080
I will make you
a snack for the crows.

666
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:09,833
Or maybe they'll
get a giant feast.

667
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,255
I suppose it would be a shame

668
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,300
to have come all this
way for nothing.

669
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:20,802
Marvelous.

670
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:03,637
Oops, missed.

671
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:08,725
Are you sure you want
to continue this, kid?

672
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,977
You don't even have
a real weapon.

673
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,980
Maybe he can't lift one.

674
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:20,362
You think your weapons
can do anything

675
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:22,738
against the God
who parted the sea?

676
00:46:22,865 --> 00:46:25,200
The God who came in
a pillar of fire?

677
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:28,578
Wait, what are you saying?

678
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:31,122
You come against me
with sword and spear,

679
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,208
but I come against you

680
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,670
in the name of the God
of heaven and earth.

681
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:41,883
The battle is His and He
will give you into our hands.

682
00:46:51,227 --> 00:46:53,978
By Dagon. Here I was

683
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:58,817
thinking that Saul had sent
a boy to do a man's job.

684
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:04,823
While actually, he was
setting me up to fight a God.

685
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:08,618
Well that's more like it.

686
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,162
This I can get behind.

687
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:16,042
Who would like to see
Goliath take on a God!

688
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,967
I accept
Your challenge.

689
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:29,723
And I now challenge You to
show Yourself and let us fight.

690
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:33,435
Come down here, Israelite God,

691
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:40,275
and I will make you kneel
before the might of Goliath!

692
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:57,625
Ah!

693
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,208
Do you really think one stone

694
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:41,252
is enough to defeat
my entire army?

695
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:12,408
Yaah!

696
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:19,750
Hm?

697
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:32,345
Did you see that, Eliab.

698
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,055
That's our brother!

699
00:49:38,102 --> 00:49:40,187
God is with him, father.

700
00:49:40,312 --> 00:49:41,563
God is with him!

701
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:42,522
Yaahhh!

702
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,030
I told you.

703
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:56,495
But now he will need God
more than ever.

704
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:01,458
Please. Look after him.

705
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,473
It's the king!

706
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:18,267
Here comes the king!

707
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,453
David! David! David!

708
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,790
David, you saved us!

709
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,583
I lent him my lyre, you know.

710
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,127
You're our champion!

711
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:48,380
He is brave, he is true.

712
00:50:48,505 --> 00:50:49,213
No!

713
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:50,090
- No?
- No?

714
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:51,882
No! It's not about me.

715
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:53,677
And he's so humble too!

716
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:56,220
David! David! David!

717
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:57,055
No!

718
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,057
Don't look at me, look at God.

719
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:01,893
Just look at him, the
way he looks at God.

720
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:03,437
No, you don't get it.

721
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:04,353
What don't we get?

722
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,772
- We don't get it.
- Tell us!

723
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:06,648

You have given our people

790
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,470
hope once more!

791
00:55:06,763 --> 00:55:09,932
We have never been so united.

792
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:15,063
Now is the time to
fully establish

793
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:17,732
the glory of our kingdom!

794
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:23,780
We will strike each
Philistine outpost.

795
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:25,782
Starting with Ziklag.

796
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:28,117
We will crush them underfoot,

797
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:31,412
the way they once crushed us!

798
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:37,752
And who better to lead us
into battle than David!

799
00:55:39,087 --> 00:55:41,715
My king, would you
like us to enquire of God

800
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,425
if this is His will?

801
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,553
I am God's anointed king.

802
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,848
My bidding is His will.

803
00:56:19,252 --> 00:56:20,087
Whoa!

804
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:32,348
What happened to
the Philistines?

805
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:33,767
It's abandoned.

806
00:56:33,892 --> 00:56:36,185
They left
everything behind.

807
00:56:40,107 --> 00:56:42,775
Why would they
leave in such a hurry?

808
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:48,698
What is it?

809
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:50,408
Amalekites.

810
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,000
Stop!

811
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,793
Father?

812
00:57:02,045 --> 00:57:02,878
Saul.

813
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,215
No.

814
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:08,718
Father? What is it?

815
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:09,885
Father?

816
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,805
We must leave this place.

817
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:13,013
- Now.
- But father.

818
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,223
I said now!

819
00:57:33,785 --> 00:57:34,577
Saul.

820
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,587
It's too late, Saul.

821
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:46,797
No, please no.

822
00:57:46,923 --> 00:57:49,675
The Amalekites escape!

823
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,597
The kingdom has been torn.

824
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:04,607
Saul! Saul!
Saul! Saul! Saul!

825
00:58:16,912 --> 00:58:19,205
Have I not brought victory?

826
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:22,667
See how we honor God
with this offering!

827
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:26,087
You honor yourself!

828
00:58:27,297 --> 00:58:31,092
While you feast,
the Amalekites escape!

829
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:33,720
Just as they attacked and
killed the weakest of us

830
00:58:33,845 --> 00:58:36,472
when we escaped Pharaoh!

831
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:39,892
You have put your entire
people in danger

832
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,895
because of your pride.

833
00:58:45,357 --> 00:58:49,610
We will never truly be free
with you on the throne.

834
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:53,280
Don't turn your back on me!

835
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:01,622
It's too late, Saul.

836
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:05,083
Today the kingdom has
been torn from you

837
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:08,003
and given to another.

838
00:59:43,665 --> 00:59:44,915
It's you.

839
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,260
It's you Samuel chose
to replace me!

840
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:58,972
Tell me...

841
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,807
Tell me it isn't so.

842
01:00:02,142 --> 01:00:04,143
I, I can't.

843
01:00:04,602 --> 01:00:07,897
I invited you into my home!

844
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,398
My king.

845
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,358
I loved you like a son!

846
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:15,028
I have done nothing
but serve you.

847
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,157
You are the anointed king.

848
01:00:17,282 --> 01:00:18,407
Jonathan is just-

849
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:19,992
Don't!

850
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:22,162
Say it.

851
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:27,125
Your words, your, your songs,

852
01:00:28,668 --> 01:00:30,587
they have bewitched me!

853
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:35,967
Go on.

854
01:00:36,092 --> 01:00:40,303
Are you not man enough to
fight me for the throne?

855
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,223
I have never wanted
the throne.

856
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:43,348
Lies!

857
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,560
You have stolen the
hearts of my people.

858
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:50,063
Even my own family
loves you more than me.

859
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:55,068
What's left to take

860
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,822
but my crown?

861
01:00:58,865 --> 01:01:01,908
The crown belongs to God.

862
01:01:02,452 --> 01:01:03,618
God!

863
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:07,290
God has turned his back on me,

864
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:12,795
and now he has turned
his back on you!

865
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:21,387
Seize him, he tried to kill me!

866
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:23,180
Hey, you!

867
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:24,682
There he is!

868
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:26,433
- Get him!
- Come back here!

869
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:27,643
He tried
to kill the king!

870
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:29,478
Stop!

871
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:31,438
Father, what happened?

872
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:34,067
He, he tried to kill me!

873
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:35,025
Who?

874
01:01:37,487 --> 01:01:38,695
Come back here!

875
01:01:38,822 --> 01:01:40,948
- Stop him!
- Don't let him escape!

876
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:42,617
Shoot, son, shoot!

877
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:44,660
Don't let
him get away!

878
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:46,120
- David?
- David?

879
01:01:47,872 --> 01:01:49,498
It's him, Jonathan.

880
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:53,210
He's the one Samuel chose
to replace me.

881
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:54,587
To replace you.

882
01:01:55,422 --> 01:01:59,550
A traitor worming his
way into our hearts.

883
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:01,552
Finish this, now!

884
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:05,848
As long as David lives neither
you nor I will be safe.

885
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:09,143
The crown belongs to us.

886
01:02:22,198 --> 01:02:23,115
Watch it!

887
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:35,168
The crown belongs to God.

888
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:41,258
Farewell, my brother.

889
01:02:42,427 --> 01:02:44,053
Seal off the city.

890
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:46,263
No one in or out
until he's found.

891
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:47,723
Don't let him out of
your sights!

892
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:48,557
Come back here!

893
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,477
There's nowhere to run!

894
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,778
Men. Follow me.

895
01:03:14,042 --> 01:03:15,125
Hey, David!

896
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,838
David, where are you going?

897
01:03:20,507 --> 01:03:21,507
Find him!

898
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:23,927
Put to the sword anyone
who aids him!

899
01:03:24,052 --> 01:03:25,762
Those loyal to David...

900
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,680
Are disloyal to me!

901
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:39,067
Find David!

902
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:41,027
He tried to kill Saul!

903
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,403
It's David!

904
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:49,868
Run, run, hurry!

905
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:52,455
What's going on?

906
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:53,747
David tried
to kill Saul!

907
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:56,833
David?
No! Never!

908
01:04:04,175 --> 01:04:05,050
Hey! Thief!

909
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,343
Stop the thief!

910
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:10,013
- Ugh!
- Hey, watch it!

911
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:11,223
David?

912
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:12,517
What have you done?

913
01:04:12,642 --> 01:04:13,725
Nothing!

914
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,228
Flush out the traitor!

915
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:17,062
Where is he?

916
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,982
It doesn't sound like nothing!

917
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:22,150
Eliab, please.

918
01:04:22,277 --> 01:04:24,445
No. This stops tonight.

919
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,113
You've put us all in danger.

920
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:27,657
If you aren't willing
to do the right thing

921
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:30,702
to protect our family, I will.

922
01:04:30,827 --> 01:04:32,077
Let go of me.

923
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:34,830
I need to go.

924
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:39,627
Follow me.

925
01:04:40,753 --> 01:04:41,587
Run! Run!

926
01:04:45,633 --> 01:04:46,967
Where is he?

927
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:47,927
That way.

928
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:52,848
What was that?

929
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:55,893

Wakey, wakey!

979
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:13,942
Definitely dead.

980
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,193
Good.

981
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:16,195
Okay.

982
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,030
Now don't suddenly
turn out to be alive

983
01:09:18,155 --> 01:09:20,448
while I'm taking your
sandals, alright?.

984
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,117
Dead bodies coming back to life,

985
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:23,993
oh, scare the heck out of me.

986
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,418
What did I just say?

987
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:36,382
Hey, what have you
found, Zaydel?

988
01:09:36,507 --> 01:09:38,467
A not dead enough dead-man.

989
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:40,760
You robbing
a defenseless man again?

990
01:09:40,887 --> 01:09:44,013
No, I was looting his corpse.

991
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,182
Big difference.

992
01:09:46,475 --> 01:09:47,602
It's David!

993
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:51,688
What? What are you doing?

994
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:53,440
Don't give him stuff!

995
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:55,858
That's the opposite of
what I'm trying to do.

996
01:09:55,985 --> 01:09:58,362
God favors him today that
we came across his path.

997
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:02,448
God's favor doesn't
look like what I expected.

998
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:06,578
Help me.

999
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:12,918
Wait, he's still got
one of my new sandals!

1000
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:14,378
Ooo!

1001
01:10:32,772 --> 01:10:37,025
Elhanan, Abishai,
what are you doing here?

1002
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:41,072
Saul didn't take too kindly
to anyone loyal to you.

1003
01:10:41,197 --> 01:10:42,572
Or thieves.

1004
01:10:42,698 --> 01:10:44,367
He didn't like them.

1005
01:10:46,577 --> 01:10:48,203
Nice sandals.

1006
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:49,622
Oh! Thanks!

1007
01:10:49,747 --> 01:10:51,373
I had them for ages.

1008
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:53,375
We're glad you're all right.

1009
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,465
Hey you. Huh!

1010
01:11:01,175 --> 01:11:03,927
Come on, the
others will want to see you.

1011
01:11:04,052 --> 01:11:04,887
Others?

1012
01:11:28,702 --> 01:11:30,662
Who are all these people?

1013
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,998
Everyone who's
running from Saul.

1014
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:34,875
David! Oh!

1015
01:11:35,417 --> 01:11:36,252
Ima!

1016
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:39,422
I missed you so much!

1017
01:11:39,547 --> 01:11:40,422
Is the family safe?

1018
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:41,757
David!

1019
01:11:41,882 --> 01:11:43,008
Ow!

1020
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:43,925
Zeruiah!

1021
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:46,595
You wait until we're
kicked out

1022
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,180
of the kingdom for a reunion?

1023
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,973
You're all here?

1024
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,977
Well, the
house got a bit crowded

1025
01:11:53,102 --> 01:11:55,270
with the soldiers and all.

1026
01:11:58,732 --> 01:12:00,650
Get him some food.

1027
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:06,157
You come at me with
sword and spear.

1028
01:12:06,282 --> 01:12:07,825
- Ah!
- Ow!

1029
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:09,242
That's not how a sling works.

1030
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:11,245
You'll be dead in a
minute, giant.

1031
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,913
Now say your next line!

1032
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:14,582
Hmp!

1033
01:12:14,707 --> 01:12:16,083
Hey! Watch it.

1034
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:26,008
How's your tapestry
working out?

1035
01:12:27,052 --> 01:12:30,638
Oh just, you know, way...

1036
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,100
Way worse than I thought!

1037
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:37,103
I don't feel like I'm
being woven,

1038
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:39,105
so much as being stabbed!

1039
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:42,317
Oh I so love you.

1040
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:46,363
Sometimes a thread
is pulled so tight

1041
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:48,157
you think it might snap.

1042
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,783
But trust the weaver.

1043
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:54,788
I feel like I snapped
a while ago, Ima.

1044
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:58,542
Then trust him to tie
you back together.

1045
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:16,352
How can you laugh when we
are being hunted by Saul?

1046
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:19,897
Did you not hear what
he did to the priests?

1047
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:26,862
That was my fault.

1048
01:13:27,822 --> 01:13:29,322
This is all my fault.

1049
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:30,407
No, David.

1050
01:13:30,532 --> 01:13:32,533
I didn't understand at first.

1051
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,995
But it's clear our king
has lost his mind.

1052
01:13:36,122 --> 01:13:37,288
Look around you.

1053
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,415
These people are loyal to you.

1054
01:13:39,542 --> 01:13:42,377
It can't be for nothing
that you were anointed.

1055
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:43,503
Abba!

1056
01:13:44,463 --> 01:13:46,132
- What did he say?
- David anointed?

1057
01:13:46,257 --> 01:13:47,967
- This is crazy!
- What does that mean?

1058
01:13:48,092 --> 01:13:49,593
Is it true?

1059
01:13:49,718 --> 01:13:51,178
It's true!

1060
01:13:51,303 --> 01:13:54,973
The Prophet Samuel
himself came to my house!

1061
01:13:55,098 --> 01:13:57,058
You're the next king?

1062
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:06,902
Yes.

1063
01:14:07,862 --> 01:14:08,862
- David?
- David? King?

1064
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:10,488
- This is wonderful!
- We could go home!

1065
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,240
Does that come with
a whole lot of money?

1066
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:15,035
With you as king,
we will at last be free.

1067
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,537
Saul won't give up
without a fight.

1068
01:14:16,662 --> 01:14:17,370
Civil war then?

1069
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:18,788
What can we do against
Saul's army?

1070
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:19,873
Saul must pay for
what he's done.

1071
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:20,832
David will save us.

1072
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,583
God has chosen David.

1073
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,418
He is God's anointed!

1074
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:25,837
He is God's anointed.

1075
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,840
He is God's anointed.

1076
01:14:27,965 --> 01:14:29,215
God's anointed.

1077
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,887
He is God's anointed.

1078
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:38,475
Saul.

1079
01:14:44,773 --> 01:14:46,275
What's wrong, sire?

1080
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,400
N-nothing.

1081
01:14:48,443 --> 01:14:52,238
I just need a moment out
of this wretched sun.

1082
01:14:53,865 --> 01:14:54,867
Of course.

1083
01:15:01,915 --> 01:15:02,582
David will save us!

1084
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,250
Saul must pay for
what he's done!

1085
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,877
We'll gather an army.

1086
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:06,795
We'll overthrow Gibeah.

1087
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,088
Finally, we'll be
free of Saul.

1088
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:12,758
David is the rightful--

1089
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,528
We will scour the
area while you rest, sire.

1090
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:41,515
My shadows, these voices,
plaguing me.

1091
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:47,270
They will not leave me.

1092
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,097
Anything?

1093
01:17:22,222 --> 01:17:24,223
No sign of them, Sire.

1094
01:17:30,022 --> 01:17:31,147
My Lord the king.

1095
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,953
Why are you hunting me?

1096
01:17:50,042 --> 01:17:53,045
Did God not just deliver
you into my hands?

1097
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,720
Some urged me to kill you,

1098
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:05,682
but I won't lay a hand on you.

1099
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:12,772
If a Philistine were chasing me

1100
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:16,902
or an Amalekite was hunting
me down, I'd know what to do.

1101
01:18:17,027 --> 01:18:18,903
I could, I could defend myself.

1102
01:18:20,155 --> 01:18:21,615
But it's you...

1103
01:18:23,117 --> 01:18:24,408
My king.

1104
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:33,585
I am not trying to
take the throne.

1105
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:52,812
David I, I-

1106
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:53,980
I...

1107
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:56,148
I know, I know, it's okay.

1108
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:06,325
What?

1109
01:19:31,852 --> 01:19:34,353
- David, he did it.
- Finally, fresh air.

1110
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:37,232
He's leaving,
we can come out.

1111
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:41,068
- I can go home, thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.

1112
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,820
We must celebrate!

1113
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:43,738
Don't.

1114
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,200
Eliab.

1115
01:19:47,325 --> 01:19:49,118
Aren't you gonna
follow your king?

1116
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:53,582
I made a mistake
following Saul.

1117
01:19:59,045 --> 01:20:01,507
Show me it's not a mistake
following you.

1118
01:20:04,092 --> 01:20:05,427
Apology accepted.

1119
01:20:06,052 --> 01:20:06,887
Huh.

1120
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:11,182
He won't stop hunting you.

1121
01:20:13,185 --> 01:20:15,395
There is one place I
know he won't follow.

1122
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:38,418
Well, I wouldn't say
it's homey.

1123
01:20:38,543 --> 01:20:40,795
You sure about this?

1124
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,257
Sure that Saul won't
pursue us here at least.

1125
01:20:43,382 --> 01:20:46,467
I think I'd rather take
my chances with Saul.

1126
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:55,143
Hmmm...

1127
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:00,482
It is true, your most
high highness.

1128
01:21:00,607 --> 01:21:02,567
The Israelites are unraveling.

1129
01:21:02,692 --> 01:21:05,612
Saul no longer has his champion.

1130
01:21:05,737 --> 01:21:07,988
Marvelous.

1131
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:10,992
Let's go and pay them
a visit, shall we?

1132
01:21:40,063 --> 01:21:41,648
David, David!

1133
01:21:41,773 --> 01:21:44,317
The Philistines are
marching on Saul!

1134
01:21:44,442 --> 01:21:46,778
The largest army I've ever seen!

1135
01:22:36,077 --> 01:22:38,663
Ah, Philistine!

1136
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:40,165
Ow! Ow!

1137
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:41,207
Take that!

1138
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:42,667
Zeruiah, wait.

1139
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:43,918
David?

1140
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:46,503
Ow! It's good to know
where you land on

1141
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,005
the fight or flight thing.

1142
01:22:48,923 --> 01:22:50,133
Sorry.

1143
01:22:50,258 --> 01:22:52,885
So what do you think?

1144
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,720
I think you've lost your mind.

1145
01:22:56,932 --> 01:22:58,725
Ima, Ima, it's me.

1146
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:02,853
Sorry, instinct.

1147
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,605
David, what on Earth
are you doing?

1148
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,315
You could've given me
a heart attack.

1149
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,693
The Philistines are
marching on Saul.

1150
01:23:08,818 --> 01:23:10,320
We will infiltrate their army

1151
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:12,613
and turn on them as they attack.

1152
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:14,615
When we deliver this
victory for Saul,

1153
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:19,037
he will know without a
doubt that I am for him.

1154
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:21,832
Everything will be back
the way it was.

1155
01:23:22,707 --> 01:23:24,542
The people are divided, David.

1156
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:26,377
Samuel said we'd be
vulnerable if--

1157
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:29,672
I'm trying to reunite us.

1158
01:23:29,797 --> 01:23:31,673
Is that so wrong?

1159
01:23:34,135 --> 01:23:36,930
I will not just leave
Saul to die.

1160
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:07,877
Quit that.

1161
01:24:08,002 --> 01:24:08,837
Okay.

1162
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:14,550
That's a big army.

1163
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:16,260
Their numbers don't matter.

1164
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:19,347
We just have to get to King
Achish and his generals

1165
01:24:19,472 --> 01:24:21,140
and the army will collapse.

1166
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:51,378
Saul, we heard you lost
your champion.

1167
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:53,465
It's time for a rematch.

1168
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:58,052
A rider approaches.

1169
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:12,275
Where is your father?

1170
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,693
Afraid to face us, is he?

1171
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:16,737
He's tired of your
talk Achish.

1172
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:21,075
Does it look like we've
come to talk?

1173
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,952
I thought we had come to talk.

1174
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:25,997
Well, yes to talk now,
but then battle.

1175
01:25:26,122 --> 01:25:27,165
Now I'm with you.

1176
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:28,165
Enough talk.

1177
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,875
We haven't come to talk!

1178
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,628
We outnumber
your army 10 to one.

1179
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:35,382
Where is the God
of Israel now?

1180
01:25:35,507 --> 01:25:39,302
Right here, and He
has you doing His will.

1181
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,887
What do you mean?

1182
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:42,388
I am not afraid.

1183
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:45,558
If we win, then it will be
by God's hand.

1184
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:50,855
If not, today you are
putting David on the throne.

1185
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:55,402
Either way, you lose.

1186
01:25:57,612 --> 01:26:01,157
Get back here,
we are not done talking!

1187
01:26:01,282 --> 01:26:03,200
I thought
you hadn't come to talk.

1188
01:26:23,638 --> 01:26:25,682
- Come on men.
- What did they say?

1189
01:26:29,602 --> 01:26:31,562
They're quaking in
their boots.

1190
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:35,942
I'm...

1191
01:26:37,777 --> 01:26:40,153
I'm sorry I brought this on you.

1192
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:44,783
I would rather be
here by your side,

1193
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:46,452
than have you face this alone.

1194
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:49,288
Black smoke.

1195
01:26:54,752 --> 01:26:56,420
Look, black smoke.

1196
01:26:56,545 --> 01:27:00,215
The Amalekites must have
found some unfortunate people.

1197
01:27:00,342 --> 01:27:02,343
Isn't that coming from Ziklag?

1198
01:27:07,265 --> 01:27:08,265
We have to go back.

1199
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:10,393
Our families.

1200
01:27:10,518 --> 01:27:13,437
Oh, this is good, very good.

1201
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:16,523
Did they not wonder why
we abandoned that city?

1202
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:17,858
Anyway, no matter.

1203
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:20,987
Looks like the Amalekites are
taking care of them for us.

1204
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:23,698
No.

1205
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:30,162
Well, come on, charge!

1206
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,718
For God and honor!

1207
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:50,850
We shouldn't have left them.

1208
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:53,185
Our families,
we have to go back.

1209
01:28:46,447 --> 01:28:47,615
Where are they?

1210
01:28:52,287 --> 01:28:53,453
My children.

1211
01:28:58,208 --> 01:28:59,918
They've been taken.

1212
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:10,680
Why God, why?

1213
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:12,640
Why?

1214
01:29:35,663 --> 01:29:37,038
This is David's fault!

1215
01:29:37,165 --> 01:29:38,207
Our families.

1216
01:29:38,332 --> 01:29:40,042
We believed in you!

1217
01:29:40,167 --> 01:29:41,085
It wasn't safe.

1218
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,545
You had the chance to
kill Saul at the cave.

1219
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,213
- Where is God now?
- We shouldn't have

1220
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:46,382
left them alone!

1221
01:29:46,507 --> 01:29:49,010
Why did I trust you?

1222
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:04,067
Remember when I told you

1223
01:30:04,192 --> 01:30:05,693
God had big plans for you?

1224
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:08,822
They may have been bigger
than even I thought.

1225
01:30:11,407 --> 01:30:14,952
Today you are
putting David on the throne.

1226
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:20,708
Our true battle

1227
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:22,835
is not against flesh and blood,

1228
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,587
but in our hearts.

1229
01:30:54,325 --> 01:30:55,827
What do you want from me?

1230
01:30:57,620 --> 01:30:59,788
I'm just a shepherd.

1231
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:03,960
A shepherd is
precisely who they need

1232
01:31:04,085 --> 01:31:07,672
to lead them back home.

1233
01:31:29,068 --> 01:31:30,152
Where are you going?

1234
01:31:31,112 --> 01:31:32,738
To bring our people home.

1235
01:31:32,863 --> 01:31:34,865
The Amalekites will kill you.

1236
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:38,035
I'm a shepherd, Eliab.

1237
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:40,287
What can I do but
look after my sheep?

1238
01:31:41,122 --> 01:31:44,583
And I trust my shepherd
to look after me.

1239
01:31:48,087 --> 01:31:49,547
What if he doesn't?

1240
01:31:51,423 --> 01:31:53,968
I'd rather take my
chances following the light,

1241
01:31:54,093 --> 01:31:56,345
than choose to live in the dark.

1242
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,390
Which do you choose, Eliab?

1243
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,203
Move.

1244
01:32:24,123 --> 01:32:25,373
You are cowards!

1245
01:32:29,837 --> 01:32:31,380
Scavengers.

1246
01:32:31,505 --> 01:32:36,010
Kings fight, sheep scatter.

1247
01:32:36,135 --> 01:32:37,762
We collect.

1248
01:32:38,637 --> 01:32:40,682
David will come.

1249
01:32:40,807 --> 01:32:42,558
He will rescue us.

He's alone?

You are
foolish to come alone.

1262
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,563
Does it look like I'm alone?

1263

1271
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:54,547
