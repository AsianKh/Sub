00:44.273 --> 00:45.460
Come on, bro!

01:09.353 --> 01:12.367
- Watch out!
- You were in the way, bro.

01:30.012 --> 01:33.040
- Can't you do it anymore?
- Do you want it to go faster?

01:50.337 --> 01:53.365
- That was cool.
- Let go of me, you skxawng.

01:56.667 --> 01:59.689
- Nice ride, bro.
- Give me four.

02:06.970 --> 02:09.905
I must make sure to come back.

02:10.009 --> 02:14.033
Little brother, tell
me one thing first.

02:15.946 --> 02:18.934
How did I die?

02:24.371 --> 02:30.331
You were shot. I wanted
us to go back for Spider.

02:30.606 --> 02:33.575
We had to.
It wasn't your fault.

02:33.671 --> 02:37.742
Tell Dad. We should
n't have been out there in the first place.

02:38.870 --> 02:41.825
We got caught
because I was disobedient.

02:42.140 --> 02:44.617
That's how you are, little brother.

02:54.165 --> 02:58.131
- I love you, brother.
- Your skxawng.

03:02.520 --> 03:07.451
I killed my brother.
Whatever happens, -

03:07.555 --> 03:10.573
- I have to live with
this for the rest of my life.

03:49.182 --> 03:53.186
- I wish I could.
- I wish I could.

03:54.647 --> 03:58.592
But if I have another
seizure underwater...

03:58.813 --> 04:00.829
Then you are me without a mask.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.630
Let's see what happens.

04:05.827 --> 04:10.833
Watch out for the stitches!
What do you think?

04:33.529 --> 04:38.512
The fire of hatred leaves
only the ashes of sorrow.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.961
My mother grieved in
the ancient way.

04:42.088 --> 04:46.492
She sang of her son's life during
the daily eclipse.

04:46.561 --> 04:48.595
Because the light always returns.

04:57.862 --> 05:01.874
There's the Na'vi method,
and then there's my father's method.

05:02.416 --> 05:04.434
Stay quiet and busy.

05:23.443 --> 05:26.438
The reef people say that
the sea washes one clean -

05:27.189 --> 05:29.648
- and washes away sins.

06:05.675 --> 06:07.675
What do you have there?

06:09.017 --> 06:11.640
We collect firearms. The ones
that are useless.

06:11.935 --> 06:13.288
Concentrate.

06:18.617 --> 06:20.601
Don't let Mom see it.

06:29.612 --> 06:33.596
- Sorry.
- Sorry. Knock!

06:40.296 --> 06:41.320
Bro.

06:43.365 --> 06:44.377
Sweaty.

06:45.716 --> 06:47.687
What's going on?

06:48.009 --> 06:49.377
Tsireya,

06:50.234 --> 06:52.001
What are you doing?

06:54.105 --> 06:56.664
It's an assault rifle.

06:56.763 --> 07:00.732
This is
the cartridge magazine. It's empty.

07:00.866 --> 07:03.825
Press it down, let it, -

07:04.359 --> 07:09.306
- and then you can fire. It
can kill many sky people.

07:09.347 --> 07:13.320
Ceramic base. They
just need to be cleaned and lubricated.

07:13.361 --> 07:18.320
- Na'vi don't use that, Jake Sully.
- Metal weapons are prohibited.

07:18.537 --> 07:21.526
You know that. Touching
them poisons the heart.

07:22.742 --> 07:25.375
Eywa takes care of us.

07:25.658 --> 07:27.101
Yes.

07:28.349 --> 07:32.898
The mourning period is not over.
You should be with your family, -

07:32.979 --> 07:37.835
- Don't run around and collect things.
Your woman needs you.

07:39.455 --> 07:44.438
My son rests with his ancestors
on the reef. This is our home.

07:45.363 --> 07:49.164
I have promised to defend it,
but I cannot do so with a spear.

07:49.390 --> 07:53.726
We sank the demon ship.
The paleskins fear us now.

07:55.021 --> 07:59.031
We were lucky. And they
have many more ships.

07:59.518 --> 08:01.507
At least we have them here.

08:01.626 --> 08:06.179
We appreciate your help,
but we don't need shooters.

08:06.458 --> 08:08.867
We need the
Rider of the Last Shadow.

08:09.163 --> 08:13.578
Ride the mighty toruk
as you once did.

08:15.800 --> 08:19.784
When you ride the animal,
you become one with the animal.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.738
And the more blood, the better.

08:24.357 --> 08:28.377
I don't want to be
Toruk Makto again.

08:29.386 --> 08:33.400
Jake Sully, you will always
be Toruk Makto.

08:34.540 --> 08:35.640
Come on.

08:35.875 --> 08:36.929
Rotxo.

08:42.335 --> 08:43.509
Can you hear me?

08:44.128 --> 08:46.234
Yes, loud and clear.
Speak up, doctor.

08:47.528 --> 08:50.493
We have finally turned the wreck -

08:50.760 --> 08:53.898
- and everything within a radius of
200 meters around it.

08:54.295 --> 08:57.718
We found no na'vilig.
Only human remains.

08:59.367 --> 09:03.617
Keep looking.
Expand the search radius.

09:04.023 --> 09:07.047
I did, however, find
an exciting new algae.

09:08.328 --> 09:09.405
Hello?

09:09.868 --> 09:11.609
Sully is still alive.

09:11.781 --> 09:14.382
Predators may have taken the bodies.

09:14.530 --> 09:20.265
No, he survived, and
he's somewhere in the area here.

09:20.352 --> 09:24.960
- If only I could get a ship...
- Your ship is lying there at the bottom.

09:25.361 --> 09:29.703
Along with my dead crew.

09:29.950 --> 09:33.925
You brought me the 42
trillion kilometers out here -

09:34.020 --> 09:38.995
- to carry out one mission. To
kill and annihilate one man.

09:39.373 --> 09:41.843
I'm not giving it up.

09:45.377 --> 09:50.367
Are we still connected?
Hello? Have they muted me?

09:56.902 --> 09:59.796
The spirit of the ancestors is in this arch.

10:01.492 --> 10:03.882
That was our strength.

10:06.115 --> 10:08.890
I can fix
it for you, Lo'ak.

10:10.340 --> 10:11.340
No!

10:12.252 --> 10:13.781
It is broken.

10:14.836 --> 10:17.242
Everything I touch
gets destroyed.

10:21.950 --> 10:24.015
They never said it out loud.

10:25.185 --> 10:27.409
But it lay and lurked,

10:27.450 --> 10:29.570
like a thanator on the run.

10:33.095 --> 10:35.671
I know you
'll never give up the bow.

10:36.914 --> 10:38.312
So here.

10:42.501 --> 10:44.489
Keep a good distance
when it hits.

11:02.956 --> 11:05.962
So you agree with Ronal?

11:08.853 --> 11:13.117
I would never contradict my
husband in front of that woman.

11:15.114 --> 11:17.118
I am a Marine.

11:18.286 --> 11:21.292
I'm not bringing
a knife to a firefight.

11:22.571 --> 11:24.585
Or beans.

11:26.530 --> 11:28.804
What should I do then?

11:29.049 --> 11:31.525
I can neither flee nor fight.

11:32.160 --> 11:36.087
Well, no, Eywa takes care of us.

11:36.339 --> 11:38.648
But where was Eywa
when our son...?

11:38.724 --> 11:40.070
Jake!

11:42.340 --> 11:45.335
I am in a place where
I have nothing.

11:46.048 --> 11:49.585
Neither my people nor my forest.

11:49.692 --> 11:52.690
Not even my father's bow.

11:54.681 --> 11:57.612
The only thing I have -

11:57.684 --> 12:02.682
- is my belief that this
is the Grandmother's plan.

12:05.363 --> 12:07.429
You have your family.

12:20.767 --> 12:26.351
And you have me. And
I love you very much.

12:49.853 --> 12:52.226
Payakan, you are too cool!

13:23.484 --> 13:26.460
How wild!

13:50.068 --> 13:53.082
- It was too bad.
- I know.

13:55.444 --> 13:58.434
- I thought
you were dead.

14:00.150 --> 14:02.685
It's a shame that
Payakan is still an outcast.

14:02.896 --> 14:05.396
He saved us all.

14:05.706 --> 14:08.497
According to the custom of the Tulkuns,
he bears the blame -

14:09.702 --> 14:13.341
- for all those who
died in the battle.

14:15.696 --> 14:18.412
- It hurts me.
- You saved us.

14:19.668 --> 14:22.702
- Never mind.
- We're brothers.

14:24.904 --> 14:26.353
Forever, brother.

14:26.580 --> 14:27.637
Always.

14:40.771 --> 14:41.807
Far!

14:45.860 --> 14:47.419
Where is the reserve?

14:47.535 --> 14:48.739
Wake up!

14:48.870 --> 14:53.052
- Where's the spare mask?
- I don't know.

14:53.271 --> 14:55.638
- Find it!
- It's not here.

14:55.710 --> 14:57.673
I can't find it.

14:59.176 --> 15:02.763
Dad, I got it!
I found it.

15:08.911 --> 15:11.667
- Breathe.
- Breathe.

15:11.708 --> 15:16.629
- Deep and calm.
- Like this.

15:16.850 --> 15:20.852
- You'll make it.
- I'm okay.

15:21.700 --> 15:26.505
- You have to be careful.
- "Caution" is my middle name.

15:26.584 --> 15:29.271
You have to be more careful.

15:29.402 --> 15:33.373
- Leave me alone.
- "Dumb" is your middle name.

15:33.688 --> 15:37.682
- You must be on your guard.
- "Skxawng" is his middle name.

15:39.554 --> 15:42.580
The wind hawkers are here!

15:43.736 --> 15:47.726
- The peddlers are coming!
- Come with me.

16:35.547 --> 16:36.579
With.

16:38.238 --> 16:43.529
- He doesn't take up much space.
- As long as he doesn't cause trouble.

16:43.755 --> 16:47.712
Down on your knees. Tuk. Kiri.

16:48.668 --> 16:50.682
Children, sit down.

16:51.694 --> 16:54.694
Mom and I have
made a decision.

16:59.279 --> 17:05.240
Spider, you need to go back to High Camp.
The windbags are taking you.

17:05.453 --> 17:08.607
You can't live in
a mask day and night.

17:08.878 --> 17:12.747
- I just want to be here with you.
- Yes, but it's too dangerous.

17:13.669 --> 17:17.919
- You're my only family.
- It's the best thing for you.

17:18.064 --> 17:22.033
- But he's our best friend.
- It's too dangerous.

17:22.214 --> 17:27.191
- You're one dead battery away from dying.
- He belongs among his own.

17:27.702 --> 17:32.663
And who is it, mother?
Stranger? Pale pig?

17:32.704 --> 17:38.674
You hate them so much that that
's all you see. That's Spider.

17:38.855 --> 17:42.122
Please, Jake. You know
I'm not causing any trouble.

17:42.353 --> 17:45.332
- That's not okay.
- Spider is part of the family.

17:45.499 --> 17:49.473
He will never be
part of our family.

17:51.584 --> 17:56.547
The caravan is the safest way to
move him. He's leaving today.

17:56.706 --> 18:02.451
Period. This is a
family, not a democracy.

18:02.591 --> 18:05.615
- I hate you!
- It's best this way.

18:05.865 --> 18:07.828
Don't touch me!

18:08.549 --> 18:09.997
It's okay.

18:10.906 --> 18:12.889
- Do you understand?
- No.

18:13.704 --> 18:17.706
I have lost my brother.
I don't want to lose any more.

18:23.998 --> 18:26.787
Sullys stick together.

18:27.235 --> 18:30.231
That's the family motto.

18:33.710 --> 18:37.349
- That's not fair.
- Okay, okay.

18:37.680 --> 18:41.302
How about we follow
him there together?

18:41.387 --> 18:45.368
Kiri, you wanted to
visit grandma.

18:45.706 --> 18:49.706
It will be an adventure
for the whole family.

18:53.704 --> 18:55.700
Nice enough.

19:08.583 --> 19:09.746
Stay here.

19:12.074 --> 19:15.365
Our agreement only applied
to the pale-skinned boy.

19:15.710 --> 19:18.710
- We're not making any trouble.
- It can't be avoided.

19:18.923 --> 19:22.224
Shopkeepers cannot choose sides.

19:22.672 --> 19:28.005
Having Toruk Makto on board
is a lot like choosing sides in war.

19:28.295 --> 19:32.810
You are mistaken. Toruk Makto
has never been on your ship.

19:35.113 --> 19:38.092
But if he was on board, -

19:38.696 --> 19:42.888
- he and his woman would gladly
fly escort and protect the caravan.

19:45.331 --> 19:50.331
Maybe. The Mangkwan robbers
have become more aggressive.

19:51.894 --> 19:54.910
- Excellent.
- It's a deal.

20:00.877 --> 20:02.310
Open the cupboard!

20:03.249 --> 20:04.249
Come on!

20:07.720 --> 20:09.490
Open the cupboard!

20:15.179 --> 20:17.154
Lo'ak!

20:17.367 --> 20:20.365
- Tsireya!
- Lo'ak!

20:21.225 --> 20:23.225
Ready to turn!

20:24.690 --> 20:26.747
Ready to turn!

20:26.852 --> 20:28.154
Bow to starboard!

20:35.851 --> 20:40.685
- Control flaps on board!
- Full to windward!

20:51.263 --> 20:53.763
- Light the ship,
- and speed up!

21:58.687 --> 22:01.707
Everyone grieves in their own way.

22:04.706 --> 22:07.706
I'm doing it up here alone.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.996
I feel he is with me.

22:14.670 --> 22:15.939
Look here.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.539
I hear his voice in the wind.

22:34.697 --> 22:36.691
Hold it here.

22:44.875 --> 22:46.840
Dad, I've been thinking about something.

22:47.147 --> 22:52.078
I should carry a rifle
and fly with you.

22:52.237 --> 22:55.214
- It's not going to happen.
- Why not?

22:55.458 --> 22:58.423
You taught me how to shoot.
I know what I'm doing.

22:58.706 --> 23:02.694
Where is your radio? I
've called you several times.

23:03.670 --> 23:04.912
Remember your radio.

23:05.836 --> 23:07.820
That's rule number 1.

23:08.896 --> 23:11.554
You can't even
figure that out.

23:22.704 --> 23:24.688
Next.

23:25.695 --> 23:26.725
The.

23:29.192 --> 23:30.386
What do you have?

23:30.592 --> 23:34.421
I had promised to watch out for beer
if they ever found anything for us.

23:34.767 --> 23:39.728
One of our patrols saw
them during a routine flight.

23:40.168 --> 23:41.679
Here is a magnification.

23:45.762 --> 23:48.185
Smile, assholes.

23:49.029 --> 23:51.607
- When?
- Today 1:50 PM.

23:51.860 --> 23:55.318
- I have the coordinates.
- Let's jump in the saddle.

24:11.093 --> 24:15.060
Pull in the rope!

24:30.700 --> 24:33.951
- Your vending machine.
- There's plenty of time.

24:45.263 --> 24:46.426
The coast is clear.

25:02.245 --> 25:05.233
- Jake!
- Mangkwaner!

25:06.163 --> 25:08.646
- To arms!
- Sound the alarm!

25:15.777 --> 25:17.777
- Kiri
- run!

25:19.552 --> 25:21.396
Take cover!

25:32.649 --> 25:36.240
- Protect your sisters.
- Yes. Stay covered.

26:04.643 --> 26:06.649
- Spider
- her!

26:09.663 --> 26:11.677
Shit, my radio.

26:24.149 --> 26:26.785
- Stay with the girls.
- What are you going to do?

26:30.180 --> 26:32.198
You should stay here!

26:59.418 --> 27:00.935
Come on!

27:01.849 --> 27:03.821
Not!

27:15.859 --> 27:17.559
Back!

28:04.410 --> 28:07.044
I am the fire!

29:09.898 --> 29:12.857
Run, run! Up, up!

29:13.289 --> 29:15.568
Come on, quickly!

29:22.062 --> 29:25.076
- Spider, jump up!
- Go!

29:52.418 --> 29:54.932
- Neytiri
- can you hear me?

30:02.380 --> 30:03.408
Pis, pis, pis.

30:04.982 --> 30:07.988
It's Lo'ak. We have to save him.

30:10.850 --> 30:12.880
- Lo'ak, jump!
- Come now!

30:15.189 --> 30:17.197
Hold on, everyone!

30:29.003 --> 30:31.013
Hold fast, Lo'ak!

30:42.134 --> 30:44.122
Hold fast, Tuk!

30:53.853 --> 30:56.268
- Spider
- with ben.

30:59.976 --> 31:01.953
Pull up.

31:02.111 --> 31:06.846
- Are you okay?
- Tuk, are you okay?

31:07.092 --> 31:09.071
Are you okay?

31:09.136 --> 31:13.152
- Can you handle it?
- My lovely girl...

31:13.804 --> 31:17.808
- Sorry, sorry.
- It's okay.

31:28.418 --> 31:30.394
Not.

31:31.112 --> 31:34.924
My backup is on board
the ship. My backup vending machine.

31:35.013 --> 31:36.479
Pis. Left,

31:36.576 --> 31:38.041
Stay here.

32:25.396 --> 32:27.380
After them!

32:28.009 --> 32:29.816
We have to leave!

32:31.772 --> 32:34.933
- Go!
- Kiri, they're coming!

32:40.599 --> 32:44.066
- They're coming!
- Go ahead!

32:46.069 --> 32:49.081
- This way!
- Come on, Tuk!

33:13.013 --> 33:15.015
Further, further.

33:18.811 --> 33:20.811
What happened?

33:22.639 --> 33:24.128
One has passed.

33:24.509 --> 33:25.917
Se, tsahìk.

33:32.292 --> 33:34.119
Knife.

33:40.357 --> 33:41.714
Follow me.

33:55.496 --> 33:57.667
- Come on.
- Knock, here.

34:04.389 --> 34:05.399
There!

34:11.200 --> 34:13.151
They are coming.

34:13.404 --> 34:16.394
Come on, this way!

34:17.641 --> 34:18.671
Onward!

34:23.376 --> 34:25.373
- This way!
- Into the water.

34:25.414 --> 34:29.418
- Come, come, come.
- Lo'ak!

34:29.616 --> 34:31.640
Come on, swim!

34:35.404 --> 34:39.925
- Lo'ak!
- Tuk, what does dad always say?

34:40.044 --> 34:43.007
- Sullyer is holding together.
- No, the other one.

34:43.400 --> 34:47.980
- Sullyer never gives up.
- Namely. Sullyer never gives up.

34:50.665 --> 34:51.683
Nothing.

34:52.612 --> 34:55.632
Kiri! Knock, hold fast!

35:00.384 --> 35:03.372
Left? Left!

35:03.974 --> 35:05.995
Spider!

35:07.392 --> 35:09.199
Take my hand.

35:17.495 --> 35:19.823
- Eagle Eye
- are you there?

35:25.418 --> 35:27.956
- Lo'ak
- answer me.

35:35.694 --> 35:38.105
- Neytiri
- are you there?

35:40.754 --> 35:41.876
Neytiri.

35:42.002 --> 35:43.988
Are you there?

35:44.460 --> 35:46.472
- Neytiri
- are you there?

35:49.456 --> 35:51.058
Tuk!

35:52.294 --> 35:53.468
Swim!

35:54.188 --> 35:55.278
Come on.

35:56.720 --> 36:00.704
- Grab a rock.
- I got you, Tuk.

36:06.199 --> 36:09.164
Is everyone okay? Spider?

36:09.408 --> 36:11.412
Yes, it's going well.

36:19.804 --> 36:24.606
- Can you see them?
- No. Let's hide.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.887
- I want to go home.
- Come on, Tuk.

36:27.452 --> 36:31.427
I'm tired and
hungry. I want to go home.

36:31.780 --> 36:35.356
Dad has no idea where we
are and we have no radio.

36:36.243 --> 36:37.259
We have to fend for ourselves.

36:38.649 --> 36:42.012
- I need a mask.
- What do we do?

36:42.088 --> 36:47.057
- Why should I decide?
- We have to do something.

36:47.224 --> 36:48.934
So stop.

36:49.545 --> 36:53.513
Lo'ak, we have to get back to the ship.

36:53.834 --> 36:56.176
But they are between us and the ship.

36:56.323 --> 37:00.356
This is where we were last seen
and where Dad will look for us.

37:00.503 --> 37:03.669
- We'll go around them.
- Good idea. Which way?

37:06.410 --> 37:09.394
- This way
- Follow me.

37:15.550 --> 37:17.848
- The game is over
- Jake.

37:23.141 --> 37:25.157
Stand completely still.

37:29.059 --> 37:32.770
- Is that what you have in you?
- That's good.

37:32.897 --> 37:36.913
Still tight-lipped.
Hands up.

37:39.390 --> 37:41.412
I killed you.

37:44.732 --> 37:47.419
I don't die that easily, Corporal.

37:55.380 --> 37:57.392
Help…

38:09.032 --> 38:11.001
Who attacked you?

38:11.418 --> 38:15.406
Mangkwan robbers.
They call themselves "The Ash People".

38:16.697 --> 38:17.697
What is it?

38:18.132 --> 38:23.528
- They cut the kuru off their enemies.
- A fate worse than death for them.

38:26.841 --> 38:29.792
- Any sign of them?
- The kids are gone.

38:30.278 --> 38:35.231
It's fully charged. That means
his mask will soon run out, -

38:35.398 --> 38:37.695
- if the Ash People don't
kill him first.

38:38.017 --> 38:41.812
We have to find them now, or
you'll never see him again.

38:45.081 --> 38:48.179
- Can you track them?
- That's not our job.

38:48.336 --> 38:51.299
- Can you track them?
- Time is running out.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.728
Now we have him.

38:55.261 --> 38:58.882
The handcuffs stay
on. Which way?

39:01.791 --> 39:03.397
You will be the death of me.

39:03.722 --> 39:05.522
Again.

39:08.772 --> 39:10.782
This way.

39:13.433 --> 39:15.635
We must be at the river soon.

39:24.499 --> 39:26.472
- Spider!
- Bro!

39:26.513 --> 39:29.464
- This is not good.
- What do we do?

39:29.505 --> 39:34.229
Save your breath, monkey. Look
at me. Breathe slowly.

39:34.521 --> 39:38.729
- Lo'ak, can you carry him?
- Yes. Come on, you'll get a ride.

39:58.539 --> 40:01.830
- They've gone through the water.
- Wise.

40:09.163 --> 40:11.932
No, no, no...

40:12.379 --> 40:14.385
Oh no, Spider.

40:16.558 --> 40:20.799
Grandmother, save the sky boy.
I beg you.

40:21.236 --> 40:24.246
There is no time for
prayers. He is dying.

40:26.216 --> 40:29.206
- It'll be okay
, mate.

40:30.490 --> 40:33.494
Kiri. Kiri, we have to move on.

40:40.692 --> 40:43.730
We have to move on. We
can't stay here.

40:45.499 --> 40:48.470
We'll be there right away.
We can't stay here.

40:48.511 --> 40:50.498
Tuk, get her.

40:50.883 --> 40:53.401
Come on, Kiri.

40:57.759 --> 40:58.781
Stop!

41:00.551 --> 41:04.947
- Come here with him.
- Kiri, stop it. Stop it.

41:05.647 --> 41:07.637
Do as I say!

41:11.419 --> 41:13.447
Put him down.

41:27.513 --> 41:29.893
What are you doing?

41:32.707 --> 41:35.721
- What are you doing?
- I'm not sure.

41:36.488 --> 41:41.197
It just feels right.
I can't talk now.

41:53.980 --> 41:55.635
Lo'ak!

42:24.583 --> 42:26.955
Take his mask off.

42:27.531 --> 42:29.877
- What?
- He can't breathe.

42:32.482 --> 42:34.096
Come on.

43:17.131 --> 43:21.125
Left? Left, Left…

43:22.926 --> 43:24.942
Oh, no.

43:34.107 --> 43:37.651
Oh no…

43:39.175 --> 43:42.147
Forgive me.

43:59.113 --> 44:02.099
Forgive me.

44:16.539 --> 44:18.221
Spider!

44:38.993 --> 44:43.112
- I'm breathing.
- Yes, monkey.

44:43.747 --> 44:45.170
You do.

44:48.376 --> 44:52.370
I'm dead. I
'm in the spirit world.

44:53.200 --> 44:55.596
No, you're still here.

44:57.771 --> 45:01.502
- I can breathe the air.
- Yes.

45:01.863 --> 45:03.846
I can breathe the air!

45:04.300 --> 45:07.557
I can breathe the air!
I can breathe the air!

45:08.813 --> 45:11.346
Then I don't
need this shit anymore.

45:12.293 --> 45:15.293
I can breathe the air!

45:15.905 --> 45:17.903
Quiet, quiet.

45:21.431 --> 45:22.815
Not.

45:24.245 --> 45:27.245
- Because whatever it was
- you did.

45:28.874 --> 45:31.864
Shit! Watch out!

45:33.102 --> 45:35.110
Stay behind me!

45:39.120 --> 45:40.150
We are trapped!

45:42.555 --> 45:44.149
Behind us!

46:02.081 --> 46:03.525
Tsahîk.

46:28.220 --> 46:31.189
How can he breathe without a mask?

46:31.543 --> 46:35.315
It doesn't matter
right now. We have to get in there.

46:37.079 --> 46:41.060
Isn't our air toxic -

46:41.539 --> 46:44.002
- for the sky people?

46:49.504 --> 46:54.822
How can you still
be alive, air-breather?

46:57.276 --> 46:59.537
Because it is Eywa's will.

47:05.531 --> 47:09.511
- Eywa?
- Me.

47:11.993 --> 47:16.994
If I cut, do you think
Eywa will come and save him?

47:17.543 --> 47:20.604
Take them off me.
They'll kill him.

47:20.712 --> 47:22.748
Do you think so?

47:24.713 --> 47:26.668
The best.

47:26.952 --> 47:31.927
Your goddess has no power here.

47:32.171 --> 47:35.161
Come on. Give me the knife.

47:39.747 --> 47:40.781
Off you go.

47:49.067 --> 47:50.085
You.

47:53.531 --> 47:56.869
- Show me
- how it works.

48:02.124 --> 48:07.166
- Teach me how to make thunder.
- It's empty. No thunder.

48:07.537 --> 48:12.519
- Make a noise.
- I can't. It's empty.

48:14.081 --> 48:17.066
Listen now. There is no thunder.

48:17.263 --> 48:22.247
- Kill the youngest.
- No, no, no!

48:34.877 --> 48:37.166
Put down your weapons!

48:40.541 --> 48:43.515
- Put them down!
- Mangkwaner!

48:43.968 --> 48:47.970
Then stay away. Away.

48:51.747 --> 48:54.205
Go away! Go away!

48:56.967 --> 49:00.914
- Dad!
- Kids, follow me.

49:01.064 --> 49:04.298
Okay, let's list it.

49:05.523 --> 49:07.517
Follow me.

49:21.531 --> 49:23.525
No! Dad!

49:29.531 --> 49:32.497
Move now.

49:40.811 --> 49:43.821
- No!
- Dad!

50:00.181 --> 50:04.185
You are strong, skyman.

50:09.437 --> 50:10.744
You.

50:13.529 --> 50:16.119
Teach me how to make thunder.

50:17.361 --> 50:19.557
This is how it works.

50:24.523 --> 50:26.987
Are you there?

50:27.973 --> 50:31.330
Then you aim for
what you want to hit...

50:33.149 --> 50:35.408
...and do it like this.

50:42.645 --> 50:43.649
Again.

50:50.240 --> 50:52.205
That's cool, right?

51:08.774 --> 51:12.049
I don't need you anymore,
skyman. Tie him up tight.

51:12.319 --> 51:16.102
- Get down on your knees!
- Prepare for sacrifice!

51:27.917 --> 51:29.882
Neytiri!

51:30.383 --> 51:33.535
Cut her down. Hold her.

51:34.518 --> 51:39.079
Neytiri, we got you.
You'll make it.

51:39.257 --> 51:43.399
Max, prepare to
operate. Open the doors!

52:02.682 --> 52:05.321
Those pigs know how to tie knots.

53:44.943 --> 53:46.923
Come on.

53:47.863 --> 53:49.843
Come on.

53:51.100 --> 53:52.116
Hurry up!

54:04.143 --> 54:06.104
It was the girl.

54:06.176 --> 54:08.516
Come on, jump in.

54:08.633 --> 54:09.852
Off you go.

54:11.405 --> 54:12.811
Come on.

54:25.586 --> 54:26.586
Tsahîk.

54:28.654 --> 54:30.662
They are gone.

54:32.818 --> 54:34.824
We lead from the air.

54:43.581 --> 54:45.587
Tarsem.

54:46.995 --> 54:50.924
- Calm, calm.
- Lie still, child.

54:51.144 --> 54:52.178
Stop her.

54:52.962 --> 54:55.925
- My children...
- Neytiri, relax.

54:56.295 --> 54:59.335
- Calm down, daughter.
- My children!

54:59.767 --> 55:03.771
Where? Where are they?

55:20.075 --> 55:23.032
- Come on. Max
- are we ready?

55:23.323 --> 55:26.297
- We're ready.
- Drop the calibration.

55:27.333 --> 55:30.665
You must rest, my child.

55:30.751 --> 55:32.755
- Bye bye.
- Thank you.

55:34.317 --> 55:37.329
- I want to ride.
- No no...

55:39.497 --> 55:41.531
I can go.

55:48.731 --> 55:50.751
I have you.

55:57.729 --> 56:00.705
It's nice here.

56:09.642 --> 56:12.212
- The coast is clear.
- Yes.

56:12.947 --> 56:17.555
Then we can resume
our settlement.

56:21.789 --> 56:23.771
I have no arrows.

56:26.331 --> 56:29.079
We still have our knives.

56:33.367 --> 56:35.369
I'm very tired.

56:37.855 --> 56:41.313
Yes. Let's save our energy.

56:43.417 --> 56:47.415
What if the flying
monkeys come again?

56:50.239 --> 56:52.274
Agreed.

57:02.732 --> 57:07.746
You and the wife must have done
something right. He's a good boy.

57:09.523 --> 57:12.087
He is a beautiful boy.

57:13.445 --> 57:17.766
This doesn't mean we
have to go on long walks together.

57:18.494 --> 57:22.488
You still need to be turned in.
Dead, if necessary.

57:24.605 --> 57:27.829
You've been here so long,
and you still don't get it.

57:29.559 --> 57:33.790
This world is much
deeper than you can imagine.

57:35.222 --> 57:37.946
You saw it this evening.

57:38.959 --> 57:42.955
With her and with him.

57:43.911 --> 57:45.919
It doesn't matter.

57:47.373 --> 57:50.610
It doesn't matter
what color I am.

57:52.329 --> 57:54.883
I still know
which side I'm on.

57:57.335 --> 58:01.962
You've got new eyes, Colonel.
You just have to open them.

58:24.327 --> 58:29.751
It's the Ash People.
Come on, we have to go!

58:29.816 --> 58:31.298
Come on, we have to go.

58:34.829 --> 58:36.845
Don't worry, it's ours.

58:38.498 --> 58:39.498
Tarsem!

58:43.335 --> 58:46.258
- Jake.
- Tarsem!

58:46.474 --> 58:50.403
- Kiri, Tuk, are you hurt?
- How did you find us?

58:51.096 --> 58:52.684
Children!

58:54.901 --> 58:59.905
- Mor!
- Tuk. Kiri. Lo'ak.

59:02.930 --> 59:05.881
Jake, are you okay?

59:06.313 --> 59:08.325
Yes, we are okay.

59:09.823 --> 59:11.791
Hey, Norm.

59:13.594 --> 59:15.153
So what?

59:18.129 --> 59:20.133
What?

59:24.331 --> 59:27.513
Well, I can breathe here now.

59:36.335 --> 59:39.942
Tuktirey. Rent.

59:45.582 --> 59:49.576
Iron Sky, Blue 1 here.
We're approaching the city wall.

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:03.645
Is he still with Sully?

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:06.903
- I bet you do.
- That's not my job.

01:00:06.994 --> 01:00:10.963
My job is to get the city built
and send Amrita home as payment.

01:00:11.145 --> 01:00:15.112
And who sets your
tasks? Those with the big picture.

01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:20.364
How are we going to colonize the planet
if we can't breathe the air?

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:24.111
If you want to find the boy,
you have to find Sully.

01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:27.458
- Like that.
- How many are missing?

01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:30.554
- Not very many.
- You said that yesterday too.

01:00:30.697 --> 01:00:34.656
Here's the latest scan.
All this is mycelium.

01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:37.779
It is basically similar
to the forest network.

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:43.866
It has embedded itself in his system
and changed it at the cellular level.

01:00:44.213 --> 01:00:48.174
It has changed his
blood, nervous system, lungs...

01:00:48.574 --> 01:00:52.395
- Can you get it out?
- No. It's an endosymbiont.

01:00:52.539 --> 01:00:57.161
They keep each other alive.
We risk killing him.

01:00:57.421 --> 01:00:59.130
Men se.

01:00:59.333 --> 01:01:03.372
He is healthy and strong.
Maybe it's a stroke of luck.

01:01:03.707 --> 01:01:05.192
A stroke of luck?

01:01:08.695 --> 01:01:11.672
What if RDA can recreate that?

01:01:11.987 --> 01:01:15.763
What if the entire population of Earth
could live here without wearing a mask?

01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:21.063
Jake, there's one more thing.

01:01:21.331 --> 01:01:25.919
Sit down, buddy. Let me see.

01:01:25.992 --> 01:01:28.004
Sid stille.

01:01:30.033 --> 01:01:32.990
- Look there.
- What are you doing?

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:36.115
- What is it?
- He's developing a kuru.

01:01:36.321 --> 01:01:39.303
- What?
- Yes.

01:01:53.868 --> 01:01:57.880
Grandma, are you there?

01:01:58.734 --> 01:02:01.754
I beg you, hear
my little voice.

01:02:03.936 --> 01:02:08.891
I prayed to you in the forest to
save my friend.

01:02:09.088 --> 01:02:11.094
I prayed so fervently.

01:02:13.333 --> 01:02:15.817
But you didn't come.

01:02:16.431 --> 01:02:20.825
You didn't answer, so I
had to do it myself.

01:02:21.441 --> 01:02:26.402
I don't know how.
I asked the roots for help.

01:02:26.545 --> 01:02:28.549
I can't remember...

01:02:31.146 --> 01:02:34.156
No, you must not reject me.

01:02:34.842 --> 01:02:39.858
Why am I like this?
How do I do this?

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.270
Talk to me!

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.255
I beg you.

01:02:45.453 --> 01:02:47.450
No, no, no...

01:02:48.327 --> 01:02:51.622
No! No!

01:03:08.965 --> 01:03:09.965
Left …

01:03:10.165 --> 01:03:16.112
Eywa never came to me. I
don't know how I did.

01:03:16.246 --> 01:03:17.536
Drink.

01:03:17.673 --> 01:03:23.106
Kiri, you have been touched
by the hand of the Almighty.

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:27.662
We've known that
since you were born.

01:03:34.848 --> 01:03:37.785
You are hiding something.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:42.614
I've felt it all my life.
Now tell me the truth.

01:03:42.998 --> 01:03:46.992
- Please.
- Tell her.

01:03:49.412 --> 01:03:50.958
The time has come.

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:55.049
My child…

01:03:55.903 --> 01:04:00.380
You don't have a father, Kiri.

01:04:00.761 --> 01:04:01.791
What?

01:04:02.366 --> 01:04:06.052
Din mor, Graces avatar …

01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:10.481
During the pregnancy, Norm took
some tests. It was a pat…

01:04:10.632 --> 01:04:15.595
A parthenogenetic birth.
You are identical to the avatar.

01:04:15.744 --> 01:04:17.766
There is no father.

01:04:19.542 --> 01:04:22.582
- Am I a clone?
- Grandchild...

01:04:23.086 --> 01:04:26.081
It was Eywa's will.

01:04:27.325 --> 01:04:33.311
When the dreamwalker's body
lay here in the hands of the Grandmother...

01:04:34.834 --> 01:04:37.828
...a seed was planted.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:55.064
That's the scoundrel. Then I'm
even more of a monstrosity.

01:04:55.319 --> 01:05:01.325
No, grandson.
You are Eywa's child.

01:05:06.691 --> 01:05:09.697
I don't care
how it happened.

01:05:10.112 --> 01:05:15.102
You are my girl. And I am
the only father you need.

01:05:19.959 --> 01:05:22.361
If I'm anything special, -

01:05:23.116 --> 01:05:26.252
- why does Eywa turn
a deaf ear to me?

01:05:28.777 --> 01:05:31.793
We don't know why, but
she's locked you out.

01:05:31.951 --> 01:05:34.298
- Like a firewall.
- An encryption.

01:05:34.583 --> 01:05:38.567
When you try to penetrate
, it bristles.

01:05:39.448 --> 01:05:43.423
Eywa has a path for you, but
she chooses to hide it.

01:05:43.785 --> 01:05:47.618
- Trust her.
- I have to find out what it is.

01:05:47.716 --> 01:05:50.470
No, you have to
stop asking.

01:05:51.184 --> 01:05:56.139
Kiri, if you try to make
contact, you risk death.

01:05:56.602 --> 01:05:59.630
If you do it underwater,
you will surely die.

01:06:04.059 --> 01:06:08.014
He can't stay here.
If the RDA gets him...

01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:10.287
Bows can't stop them.

01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:14.777
If he is a danger
to the people and everything else...

01:06:15.629 --> 01:06:18.633
...then we must kill him.

01:06:22.042 --> 01:06:25.775
It's Spider. He
can come with us.

01:06:25.933 --> 01:06:27.445
Out to the reef.

01:06:27.486 --> 01:06:29.267
There we can protect him.

01:06:30.787 --> 01:06:33.791
Toruk Makto knows best.

01:06:34.426 --> 01:06:37.407
Honey, it's not on.

01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:39.573
It's decided.

01:06:50.546 --> 01:06:52.542
Get me close.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:02.839
Get me in the zone. Get me
in the zone with the cannon.

01:07:03.497 --> 01:07:05.884
10 meter.

01:07:06.845 --> 01:07:07.915
Such.

01:07:08.032 --> 01:07:09.032
And …

01:07:24.965 --> 01:07:27.983
Right in the lung. She's bleeding to death.

01:08:02.105 --> 01:08:08.189
A new demon ship has arrived.
Several Tulkun have been killed.

01:08:08.619 --> 01:08:10.590
It hurts me.

01:08:10.779 --> 01:08:14.746
Jake Sully, the outcast
, incites the young bulls.

01:08:14.787 --> 01:08:18.290
The Tulkun have called a
council meeting to discuss him.

01:08:19.525 --> 01:08:21.503
You need to rest.

01:08:22.352 --> 01:08:26.556
- The one that must be removed.
- Kids, come with me.

01:08:37.785 --> 01:08:41.040
When it grows out,
I'll have my own ilu.

01:08:41.245 --> 01:08:44.218
Skxawng. It will be
a very small ilu.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:48.471
Wait and see. I'm going to
have my own little wing.

01:08:48.779 --> 01:08:52.368
How did it
happen that your daughter, -

01:08:52.772 --> 01:08:57.763
- your half-blood daughter,
who has no training...

01:08:58.374 --> 01:08:59.394
Hold her.

01:09:00.248 --> 01:09:03.235
...could do what
no tsahìk could?

01:09:03.605 --> 01:09:06.560
Do you doubt Eywa's will?

01:09:06.602 --> 01:09:09.620
- I am tsahîk!
- Then show it.

01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:14.267
Your herbs do nothing.
The herbs from my forest are better.

01:09:15.636 --> 01:09:18.603
I tell you to rest
, but you don't listen.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.787
And then you blame the herbs.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.267
Sid stille.

01:09:26.247 --> 01:09:27.247
Idiot!

01:09:27.455 --> 01:09:32.425
Careful, tsahìk, or I
'll forget you're expecting.

01:09:53.052 --> 01:09:56.013
The matriarch has
spoken. She says, -

01:09:56.241 --> 01:10:01.306
- that the outcast continues to commit crimes
against the Tulkun's way of life.

01:10:01.532 --> 01:10:05.861
He was ostracized for killing,
and now he has done it again.

01:10:06.469 --> 01:10:10.923
He attacked a demon ship
and brought death upon us, -

01:10:12.225 --> 01:10:14.478
- including Toruk Makto's son.

01:10:16.411 --> 01:10:19.431
- It wasn't Payakan's fault.
- Not now.

01:10:25.214 --> 01:10:28.244
She says he keeps
causing trouble -

01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:31.532
- and put
grills in the heads of the young people.

01:10:33.289 --> 01:10:35.244
That's a lie.

01:10:35.589 --> 01:10:38.650
She says he just
wants to spread more death.

01:10:39.341 --> 01:10:44.126
Why don't you say
something? Say something.

01:10:49.374 --> 01:10:54.307
She says that the outcast
must not stay in these waters.

01:10:54.755 --> 01:10:57.372
He must travel where
his song cannot be heard.

01:10:57.842 --> 01:10:59.489
Banished for life.

01:11:01.542 --> 01:11:02.973
That's not fair.

01:11:05.654 --> 01:11:06.981
It's decided.

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:11.731
You will never hear my song again.

01:11:12.333 --> 01:11:14.325
Nej! Payakan!

01:11:15.567 --> 01:11:17.324
Brother!

01:11:18.075 --> 01:11:19.121
Payakan!

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.360
Brother!

01:11:27.424 --> 01:11:30.422
This is wrong!

01:11:31.229 --> 01:11:36.074
- You have no right to speak here.
- Payakan fought for us.

01:11:36.237 --> 01:11:38.988
He saved your daughter's life!

01:11:39.104 --> 01:11:42.069
You are not allowed to speak.
This is a council meeting.

01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:46.667
- The elders have spoken.
- The Tulkun are being exterminated.

01:11:47.006 --> 01:11:51.973
- Lo'ak, that's good.
- Lo'ak speaks the truth.

01:11:52.162 --> 01:11:58.536
Payakan fought for us.
More than any of you did.

01:11:58.785 --> 01:12:02.765
- He fought for us!
- Sit down! Take him away!

01:12:03.104 --> 01:12:05.825
- Make room.
- Dad, listen to him.

01:12:09.055 --> 01:12:11.032
What are you doing?

01:12:11.777 --> 01:12:14.825
- You never back me up!
- Come here.

01:12:17.144 --> 01:12:19.142
The meeting continues.

01:12:21.789 --> 01:12:27.771
We are at war. Are you in?
Ignoring an order costs lives.

01:12:28.771 --> 01:12:31.317
For Spider's sake,
we're keeping a low profile, -

01:12:31.406 --> 01:12:36.402
- but that troublemaker would have
gotten the whole RDA on our backs.

01:12:37.777 --> 01:12:40.552
You want to get rid of
him. That's why you kept quiet.

01:12:40.765 --> 01:12:43.919
- He's unpredictable
. - Just like you.

01:12:44.016 --> 01:12:48.022
If you hadn't had to save
him, your brother would still be...

01:12:55.278 --> 01:12:57.755
It wasn't my fault.

01:13:00.116 --> 01:13:02.132
It wasn't my fault!

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.011
Lo'ak.

01:13:24.157 --> 01:13:26.175
Go after him, Jake.

01:13:29.682 --> 01:13:32.710
Otherwise you will lose another son.

01:13:35.229 --> 01:13:38.235
I have nothing to say to him.

01:13:39.517 --> 01:13:42.239
Don't blame Lo'ak.

01:13:44.116 --> 01:13:47.747
You said you could
protect our family.

01:13:48.997 --> 01:13:52.990
- I thought we were safe here.
- Our son is dead.

01:13:53.327 --> 01:13:55.559
I was wrong.

01:13:57.073 --> 01:14:00.700
Should I say that everything
I've done is wrong?

01:14:01.548 --> 01:14:03.660
That I was the one who
killed our son?

01:14:08.306 --> 01:14:13.825
Yet we find ourselves here
to protect a pale skin.

01:14:14.301 --> 01:14:16.232
A stranger.

01:14:16.397 --> 01:14:19.981
If I had to choose between
my family and a pale skin, -

01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:22.235
- I would kill him on the spot.

01:14:22.777 --> 01:14:27.223
Stop, stop, stop.
We're not going out there.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:32.456
You have chosen once before
between your family and a pale skin.

01:14:36.783 --> 01:14:40.793
You can't live
like this. You hate.

01:14:42.473 --> 01:14:45.455
I hate them, Jake.

01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:50.411
I hate them. I hate
their pale, little hands.

01:14:51.276 --> 01:14:54.606
I hate their madness.

01:14:57.359 --> 01:15:01.381
I'm human
inside. Do you hate me?

01:15:03.991 --> 01:15:05.988
I will always be
a stranger in your eyes, right?

01:15:06.598 --> 01:15:09.263
No matter how long
I live in this body.

01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:13.146
Do you hate your children?

01:15:14.446 --> 01:15:16.464
And their foreign hands?

01:15:17.302 --> 01:15:18.817
The best.

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:24.216
Are you ashamed when they do
something wrong or different?

01:15:26.114 --> 01:15:30.114
So it's because of
their human side, right?

01:15:31.253 --> 01:15:33.247
Because.

01:15:50.678 --> 01:15:52.641
Sorry, honey.

01:15:53.128 --> 01:15:56.130
Sorry. Sorry.

01:15:59.503 --> 01:16:03.483
We need to stand together now.

01:16:04.222 --> 01:16:06.661
Family is our fortress.

01:16:29.088 --> 01:16:32.055
People say that
when you touch steel, -

01:16:32.166 --> 01:16:34.317
- then it poisons one's heart.

01:16:58.923 --> 01:17:00.509
Lo'ak!

01:17:01.384 --> 01:17:04.023
- Bror.
- Lo'ak!

01:17:08.775 --> 01:17:14.716
Stay alive, brother.
We need you.

01:17:14.765 --> 01:17:18.194
- We love you.
- You have greatness within you.

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.360
The strength of the ancestors resides here.

01:17:40.343 --> 01:17:41.999
A bow can be repaired.

01:17:59.135 --> 01:18:01.151
Good, good.

01:18:09.769 --> 01:18:11.889
The moment of truth.

01:18:22.942 --> 01:18:24.350
Off you go.

01:18:28.353 --> 01:18:31.163
- Can you feel her?
- Yes.

01:18:31.315 --> 01:18:34.788
- I have fins.
- Yes, you do.

01:18:38.618 --> 01:18:40.967
That's it, monkey!

01:19:02.576 --> 01:19:05.397
Stay calm!

01:19:07.781 --> 01:19:09.750
Spider.

01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:13.763
- They don't know anything.
- Yes, they do.

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:15.380
They just don't want to come out with it.

01:19:17.117 --> 01:19:20.327
We have one
more option, but it is extreme.

01:20:03.543 --> 01:20:06.131
You remember me, right?

01:20:08.199 --> 01:20:12.413
- Mine!
- I have something for your tsahìk.

01:20:12.773 --> 01:20:14.766
Take me to your tsahîk…

01:20:15.362 --> 01:20:21.330
Oh, there's no need
for that. I'll keep an eye on you.

01:20:29.014 --> 01:20:30.584
Onward!

01:20:37.901 --> 01:20:38.913
True!

01:20:43.941 --> 01:20:44.941
True!

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.616
I can get lots of them.

01:21:14.529 --> 01:21:17.166
What is your name, skyman?

01:21:17.410 --> 01:21:21.755
Quaritch. Oberst Miles Quaritch.

01:21:27.099 --> 01:21:29.113
If you touch me again,
I'll kill you.

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:32.943
You're not killing anyone.

01:21:33.877 --> 01:21:37.885
I don't agree with that. Nak him.

01:22:02.157 --> 01:22:03.935
Cleverly done…

01:22:05.179 --> 01:22:07.148
… Quaritch.

01:22:07.416 --> 01:22:12.414
You'll be next, you scoundrel,
so think carefully.

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.374
Come on.

01:22:17.743 --> 01:22:19.452
Let's talk further inside.

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:28.280
What are you doing, boss?

01:22:44.416 --> 01:22:46.376
Cozy.

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:50.469
Do you understand…

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.316
…everyone is lying to me.

01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:05.852
It is said that you can make a
stone tell the truth.

01:23:06.412 --> 01:23:10.563
You're looking for a man. A
skyman like you.

01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:14.790
Not like me. He's a traitor.

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.006
Then he must die.

01:23:20.012 --> 01:23:23.099
Varang can help
you find him.

01:23:23.952 --> 01:23:26.938
- And the second
- you are looking.

01:23:28.418 --> 01:23:32.372
This air breathes.

01:23:37.404 --> 01:23:40.123
- But first I must
- See your soul.

01:23:41.224 --> 01:23:42.810
Stand still.

01:23:44.321 --> 01:23:46.319
Stand still.

01:24:08.786 --> 01:24:10.772
Strong tobacco.

01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:51.606
This is the only
uncorrupted thing in this world.

01:24:55.412 --> 01:24:59.357
The fire came from the mountain
when I was a child.

01:25:00.836 --> 01:25:03.318
It burned our forest...

01:25:04.639 --> 01:25:06.653
...and took everything.

01:25:11.046 --> 01:25:14.709
My people were starving.

01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:17.856
They begged for help.

01:25:19.702 --> 01:25:22.728
But Eywa did not come.

01:25:24.694 --> 01:25:28.670
So I sought out the fire...

01:25:31.236 --> 01:25:34.240
...and learned about its nature.

01:25:39.412 --> 01:25:42.418
I am the fire.

01:25:44.412 --> 01:25:49.724
By my hand
my people have become strong.

01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:54.544
We don't lie down to
die just because Eywa -

01:25:54.684 --> 01:25:56.694
- turns his back on us.

01:25:58.063 --> 01:26:01.404
We turn our backs on Eywa.

01:26:02.403 --> 01:26:07.740
A weak mother for weak children.

01:26:09.713 --> 01:26:12.674
We are not breastfeeding -

01:26:12.849 --> 01:26:15.887
- at the breast of weakness.

01:26:19.778 --> 01:26:21.802
No …

01:26:23.595 --> 01:26:28.609
...only true words will
come upon your tongue.

01:26:34.418 --> 01:26:38.402
You have a strong
heart. No fear.

01:26:39.452 --> 01:26:43.756
Off. It wasn't done nicely.

01:26:44.177 --> 01:26:48.171
I will eat your
heart, Quaritch.

01:26:52.899 --> 01:26:56.915
But first you have to answer me.

01:26:59.684 --> 01:27:02.676
What are you coming for?

01:27:06.592 --> 01:27:08.602
To talk to you.

01:27:09.952 --> 01:27:11.976
Do you want to serve me?

01:27:13.408 --> 01:27:18.654
I am no one's servant.
I need you.

01:27:19.670 --> 01:27:24.651
I don't need you.
But I could hold you -

01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:29.256
- like a slave to
please me.

01:27:29.961 --> 01:27:35.948
It sounds mighty cozy,
but it's not what you're craving.

01:27:36.255 --> 01:27:38.787
What am I craving then?

01:27:40.061 --> 01:27:42.077
That you've never had.

01:27:44.056 --> 01:27:46.034
Not a relative.

01:27:49.591 --> 01:27:53.935
You want to spread the fire
to the whole world, right?

01:27:55.410 --> 01:27:59.374
I can get you
weapons, radios...

01:27:59.418 --> 01:28:03.514
...and rocket launchers. All
that powerful magic.

01:28:04.414 --> 01:28:08.318
Give orders from a distance
and strike like lightning.

01:28:09.418 --> 01:28:14.217
All clans, as
far as you can fly, -

01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:17.951
- will bow to Varang.

01:28:23.759 --> 01:28:25.787
If you are going to punish Eywa...

01:28:27.416 --> 01:28:29.410
...you need me.

01:28:34.414 --> 01:28:36.615
I see you.

01:28:37.746 --> 01:28:40.357
God damn it, you do that.

01:29:59.288 --> 01:30:01.529
When I get in touch again,
whenever that may be, -

01:30:01.587 --> 01:30:03.826
- I can show
you the way into the spirit world.

01:30:06.557 --> 01:30:11.154
- Can't I go there now?
- No. Not without me.

01:30:11.222 --> 01:30:16.381
A sky person can't just
wade in. The ancestors would have a foal.

01:30:26.464 --> 01:30:30.468
They have started arriving
for the calf communion.

01:30:32.432 --> 01:30:35.990
Yearling calves and newborns -

01:30:36.246 --> 01:30:40.206
- will bond with Eywa for the first time .

01:31:07.519 --> 01:31:09.493
Let me see.

01:31:11.483 --> 01:31:14.974
Great. It suits you.

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:18.107
- Come to the party.
- No, no, no.

01:31:18.642 --> 01:31:21.644
Then I'll stay here with you.

01:31:28.497 --> 01:31:34.422
I shouldn't tell you
this, but my tulkun sister says, -

01:31:34.463 --> 01:31:38.779
- that they have heard Payakan calling
very faintly to his birth clan.

01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:40.923
Where?

01:31:41.105 --> 01:31:43.990
Tulkun singing can
be heard from a long distance.

01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:45.982
Say it.

01:32:14.947 --> 01:32:16.943
Lo'ak …

01:32:20.347 --> 01:32:21.748
Goodbye, mother.

01:32:22.730 --> 01:32:24.740
Where are you going?

01:32:26.203 --> 01:32:27.646
Just out.

01:32:29.503 --> 01:32:31.576
There's something I
have to do.

01:32:39.236 --> 01:32:41.232
Lo'ak!

01:32:42.795 --> 01:32:43.813
Lo'ak!

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:46.846
Vent!

01:32:48.935 --> 01:32:49.935
Lo'ak!

01:32:56.732 --> 01:33:00.928
Yes, we must find Payakan's brother.

01:33:06.497 --> 01:33:09.498
We can't leave
before communion.

01:33:09.662 --> 01:33:13.631
- I have to.
- We're leaving.

01:33:14.274 --> 01:33:15.912
Everyone.

01:33:16.771 --> 01:33:20.279
Get weapons and food.
Not a word to anyone.

01:33:27.088 --> 01:33:29.443
Our children have set
out to find him.

01:33:30.031 --> 01:33:32.662
- Did you allow it?
- They didn't ask.

01:33:33.349 --> 01:33:35.352
Then the riders must follow them.

01:33:35.503 --> 01:33:40.693
They must protect the calf communion
if the demon ships come.

01:33:41.371 --> 01:33:43.731
My boy is all alone.

01:33:44.505 --> 01:33:47.701
He will return home
when he is ready.

01:33:48.489 --> 01:33:50.701
That is his path.

01:33:54.691 --> 01:33:56.990
Look what he's done.

01:33:57.859 --> 01:34:02.396
The strength of the ancestors
runs in your son's veins.

01:34:03.105 --> 01:34:05.105
Believe it.

01:34:11.232 --> 01:34:13.244
The essence of water has
no beginning...

01:34:16.013 --> 01:34:19.015
… and no end.
The sea is your home …

01:34:23.795 --> 01:34:25.797
… before your birth …

01:34:31.872 --> 01:34:33.884
...and after your death.

01:34:56.461 --> 01:35:00.154
Where is he who
is called Toruk Makto?

01:35:00.355 --> 01:35:02.356
How many fish are
there in the sea? One, two.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:06.574
How many birds are
there in the sky? One, two, three.

01:35:07.628 --> 01:35:12.099
Couldn't you have asked Eywa
to make me taller? Or bluer?

01:35:12.302 --> 01:35:16.506
No. I was busy
saving your life, skxawng.

01:35:16.823 --> 01:35:19.835
Just a few centimeters.

01:35:21.367 --> 01:35:24.092
The old woman can do everything.

01:35:26.262 --> 01:35:29.631
- You are perfect
- exactly as you are.

01:35:49.229 --> 01:35:51.029
- Come on
- monkey.

01:35:53.807 --> 01:35:56.662
The next thing will be to learn
how to ride a glider.

01:35:57.038 --> 01:36:00.514
So you can become a mighty
warrior and protect us.

01:36:00.707 --> 01:36:04.060
It's not the size
that counts, but the doing.

01:36:05.021 --> 01:36:06.209
What now?

01:36:13.277 --> 01:36:15.277
Run! Run!

01:36:24.461 --> 01:36:26.453
Run, run!

01:36:27.443 --> 01:36:30.123
- Spider!
- Here, assholes!

01:36:32.407 --> 01:36:36.717
Come on! Skxawng!
This way, you bastard!

01:36:38.813 --> 01:36:41.837
Is that all you're good for?

01:36:47.403 --> 01:36:52.857
So, be careful with that knife.
Someone could get hurt.

01:36:54.458 --> 01:36:55.826
Air breaths.

01:37:10.793 --> 01:37:12.807
- We're flying.
- Take off!

01:37:13.831 --> 01:37:17.224
Dragonfly, Blue 1 here. Be well.

01:37:31.983 --> 01:37:33.001
Tuk!

01:37:40.807 --> 01:37:42.974
- They're locking us in.
- To arms!

01:37:43.269 --> 01:37:46.779
- Where is your sister?
- Where are Kiri and Spider?

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:50.500
Far!

01:37:50.625 --> 01:37:54.623
- Where's Spider?
- The Blue Colonel took him.

01:38:07.317 --> 01:38:08.731
Day ham.

01:38:29.195 --> 01:38:30.576
Stay calm.

01:38:30.805 --> 01:38:34.224
No fear. No fear.

01:38:41.682 --> 01:38:43.674
Jake Sully!

01:38:44.531 --> 01:38:47.516
- Get the girls out of here.
- I'm not leaving you.

01:38:47.831 --> 01:38:51.798
They have Spider. There's nothing
holding them back now.

01:38:52.459 --> 01:38:57.959
- People are going to die.
- You can't ask me this.

01:38:59.803 --> 01:39:05.248
- It's the only solution.
- Jake Sully! Come forward freely!

01:39:05.597 --> 01:39:07.562
You have to leave now.

01:39:07.697 --> 01:39:11.420
Take your sister
and hide. Now!

01:39:12.825 --> 01:39:18.514
- I'll stay. I'll kill many.
- You don't draw that bow.

01:39:18.805 --> 01:39:20.823
Swear on it.

01:39:22.821 --> 01:39:26.373
I know he's
here. Hand him over.

01:39:26.821 --> 01:39:31.357
He is metkayina. One
of us. He is one of us!

01:39:32.138 --> 01:39:34.990
- Set something on fire.
- Dragon 24 …

01:39:35.096 --> 01:39:38.748
- Use fire weapon.
- Switches to fire weapon.

01:39:55.394 --> 01:39:58.359
I want Jake Sully!

01:39:58.752 --> 01:40:02.748
The fire is still! The fire is still!

01:40:03.308 --> 01:40:04.332
The fire is at rest.

01:40:05.335 --> 01:40:07.321
Received.

01:40:09.199 --> 01:40:11.256
This is my path, brother.

01:40:28.825 --> 01:40:32.092
- Colonel.
- Corporal.

01:40:32.805 --> 01:40:35.904
Take me and leave the others alone.

01:40:36.455 --> 01:40:40.483
That's not good enough.
I want the lady with me.

01:40:44.326 --> 01:40:49.327
- You get me.
- Both of you, or I'll blow up the city.

01:40:49.837 --> 01:40:52.178
Pregnant women and children.

01:40:52.516 --> 01:40:56.646
I shoot old ladies for
pickling fish because I'm so fucking happy.

01:40:57.203 --> 01:41:03.670
And my friends, I'm itching to
grab your neck and take your scalp.

01:41:19.655 --> 01:41:22.691
Really? Is that what you want?

01:41:23.817 --> 01:41:29.778
When I let go of my arm, you
and your new lady will die. You especially will die.

01:41:29.819 --> 01:41:32.760
Then you die too.

01:41:32.801 --> 01:41:36.794
Maybe. But you're unlikely
to hit all of us.

01:41:36.835 --> 01:41:41.443
Maybe we storm, so the helicopters
hesitate because we look alike.

01:41:41.825 --> 01:41:44.831
And when you then beg for mercy...

01:41:46.247 --> 01:41:48.232
...I'll scalp you.

01:41:48.829 --> 01:41:54.459
Well, I don't know
if you're smart or stupid.

01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:57.645
You've never seemed very smart.

01:41:57.835 --> 01:42:03.795
Give me your word as
a soldier. Safety for my people.

01:42:04.821 --> 01:42:06.815
Burn them, Quaritch.

01:42:15.817 --> 01:42:17.813
Do we have a deal?

01:42:22.476 --> 01:42:26.490
Top. A little finger promise?

01:42:35.835 --> 01:42:37.224
Day ham.

01:42:38.574 --> 01:42:39.602
Turn around.

01:42:45.481 --> 01:42:46.771
Forward.

01:43:07.819 --> 01:43:10.839
- See you later
- Mrs. Sully.

01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:15.222
Departure.

01:43:58.811 --> 01:44:02.615
- What's happening?
- We're being attacked by Fury Riders.

01:44:02.674 --> 01:44:04.146
Shoot them down.

01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:07.639
Our weapons are
locked. They have IFF markings.

01:44:09.092 --> 01:44:11.793
- Zoom in.
- Lock on target.

01:44:49.833 --> 01:44:51.514
Straighten your back.

01:44:52.426 --> 01:44:54.422
Don't show fear.

01:45:00.453 --> 01:45:02.440
- Okay
- hold ham.

01:45:02.825 --> 01:45:05.829
- Calm down, calm down.
- Come here!

01:45:07.304 --> 01:45:09.576
- Jake!
- Go ahead.

01:45:09.827 --> 01:45:12.799
Jake! Jake!

01:45:15.825 --> 01:45:17.521
Jake!

01:45:33.831 --> 01:45:39.639
Mission accomplished. Jake
Sully aka Toruk Makto.

01:45:54.587 --> 01:46:00.592
Not only do you hand
out weapons, you also bring enemies home with you.

01:46:02.411 --> 01:46:04.443
Not enemies. Allies.

01:46:05.817 --> 01:46:10.568
General Ardmore, this is
Varang, the tsahìk of the Mangkwan tribe.

01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:19.654
Listen, Colonel Blackfoot, I want
those barbarians away from my base.

01:46:19.819 --> 01:46:23.835
Right now. That
also applies to your little friend.

01:46:29.474 --> 01:46:31.889
- Don't be stupid
, Madam General.

01:46:32.938 --> 01:46:34.521
Take the victory.

01:46:36.721 --> 01:46:39.404
We got him!

01:46:41.811 --> 01:46:43.811
An era is over.

01:47:01.429 --> 01:47:02.469
Tsahîk.

01:47:04.829 --> 01:47:06.514
Come here.

01:47:22.914 --> 01:47:23.922
Calm.

01:47:31.484 --> 01:47:34.053
Now comes a little dot.

01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:35.227
Lie still.

01:47:37.825 --> 01:47:39.839
So it's just before.

01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:41.238
Hold it there.

01:47:47.501 --> 01:47:49.501
Payakan!

01:47:51.958 --> 01:47:53.950
Payakan!

01:47:59.795 --> 01:48:02.756
People say that
the sea washes one clean.

01:48:03.217 --> 01:48:04.958
Payakan!

01:48:07.928 --> 01:48:10.615
- It's Lo'ak.
- It's him!

01:48:10.661 --> 01:48:12.636
Skxawng, over here!

01:48:13.154 --> 01:48:14.591
Tsireya!

01:48:18.264 --> 01:48:21.956
They also say that if you see
the deep sea tsyonges...

01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:27.964
... are spirits that
come to judge one.

01:48:39.930 --> 01:48:40.962
Tsyonger!

01:49:56.705 --> 01:50:00.727
Lo'ak! Lo'ak! Lo'ak!

01:50:05.255 --> 01:50:06.840
Tsireya.

01:50:11.611 --> 01:50:13.590
- Thank you
- Grandma.

01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:16.514
- Now let him breathe.
- Let him go.

01:50:20.537 --> 01:50:25.537
- You came and saved me.
- My friend's path is my path.

01:50:29.443 --> 01:50:32.453
- Is that your sister?
- Yes.

01:50:32.605 --> 01:50:36.627
- Can she hear Payakan?
- He's on his way here.

01:50:43.630 --> 01:50:45.092
What's new?

01:50:45.688 --> 01:50:49.795
- The mycelium that lives in him...
- Is there anything living in him?

01:50:49.875 --> 01:50:53.240
Yes. An endosymbiont, which
regulates ion exchange...

01:50:53.534 --> 01:50:57.264
Never mind how it
works. Can we reproduce it?

01:51:02.401 --> 01:51:04.842
Lock me out!

01:51:09.176 --> 01:51:12.149
I've asked the gowns
to leave you alone.

01:51:12.603 --> 01:51:14.170
Where is Jake?

01:51:14.552 --> 01:51:20.154
In a cage where he belongs
. Here's a burger.

01:51:20.566 --> 01:51:23.912
- You're not hurting him.
- He doesn't concern you anymore.

01:51:24.946 --> 01:51:28.895
You are with me
now. I am your father.

01:51:28.936 --> 01:51:30.913
My father is dead.

01:51:31.396 --> 01:51:34.921
You're just an artificial thing
equipped with his memories.

01:51:35.201 --> 01:51:39.903
No, I'm still
me. I've been looking.

01:51:39.944 --> 01:51:44.357
Se. "Oberst Miles Quaritch."

01:51:44.539 --> 01:51:45.959
"Deceased."

01:51:50.443 --> 01:51:54.865
We didn't get to chat much
when we were out in the jungle, but -

01:51:56.014 --> 01:52:01.131
- I owe you a thank you. You
got me out of a sinking ship.

01:52:01.730 --> 01:52:05.746
- You saved my life.
- I regret it now.

01:52:07.531 --> 01:52:11.514
Maybe it's true.
Maybe it's not.

01:52:11.954 --> 01:52:14.962
No matter what,
I am indebted to you.

01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:21.306
And I must say
that I am proud of you.

01:52:23.946 --> 01:52:29.107
You are incredible. You have
a backbone and a brain, -

01:52:29.954 --> 01:52:32.670
- and you are brave as a lion.

01:52:33.942 --> 01:52:36.954
I see myself in you.

01:52:38.521 --> 01:52:42.435
But above all,
I see your mother in you.

01:52:43.144 --> 01:52:47.381
She was Balstyrian.

01:52:48.537 --> 01:52:50.951
Hard to live with, but -

01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:55.940
- I loved her. And
as she loved you.

01:52:58.468 --> 01:53:01.740
She had such a hard time
getting into that helicopter -

01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:05.952
- to fly into battle and
leave behind his little boy.

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:11.279
Your mother died a hero.

01:53:12.930 --> 01:53:14.904
You have that in you too.

01:53:17.518 --> 01:53:23.487
But enough about that. I just came
to say that I'm here for you.

01:53:23.958 --> 01:53:26.926
If you need me...

01:53:28.942 --> 01:53:30.918
...then I'm here.

01:53:33.948 --> 01:53:35.514
Can I keep it?

01:53:45.922 --> 01:53:46.958
Now eat something.

01:53:58.609 --> 01:54:00.131
Brother!

01:54:04.119 --> 01:54:05.982
It's good to see you.

01:54:06.715 --> 01:54:09.699
I see you, brother.

01:54:14.547 --> 01:54:17.162
What's in the way?

01:54:17.532 --> 01:54:20.546
It's serious.

01:54:21.832 --> 01:54:23.817
Didn't find your birth clan?

01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:25.926
Because.

01:54:26.956 --> 01:54:30.934
But there is only one left.

01:54:37.495 --> 01:54:39.499
I am Ta'nok.

01:54:40.398 --> 01:54:43.224
Look what they have done to me!

01:54:43.868 --> 01:54:45.518
Shoot me!

01:54:45.644 --> 01:54:47.521
Blinded me!

01:54:48.609 --> 01:54:51.584
Look what the sky people
have done to me!

01:54:51.946 --> 01:54:57.389
The Tulkuns have started to arrive,
but there are most of them during the eclipse.

01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:00.670
It's the day after tomorrow.
That's when we strike.

01:55:01.365 --> 01:55:02.865
Just a moment.

01:55:02.962 --> 01:55:08.615
You're talking about mass killing.
The extermination of entire herds.

01:55:08.818 --> 01:55:11.709
Namely. We can fulfill an
entire year's quota in one day.

01:55:11.936 --> 01:55:15.905
- They are intelligent beings.
- Who are you?

01:55:15.946 --> 01:55:19.935
- Ian Garvin
- marine biologist.

01:55:20.162 --> 01:55:25.678
The creatures have culture and music,
and they give each other names.

01:55:25.942 --> 01:55:29.420
This gathering is a
spiritual event for them.

01:55:29.584 --> 01:55:34.529
- Come down from the ivory tower.
- I didn't agree to this.

01:55:34.938 --> 01:55:38.646
Thank you, Dr. Garvin. Your
protest has been noted.

01:55:38.736 --> 01:55:40.217
- Is it recorded?
- Yes.

01:55:40.924 --> 01:55:44.919
Submarines and speedboats,
you form a chain.

01:55:45.349 --> 01:55:50.956
You drive the animals in, where
a natural bottleneck is formed towards the islands.

01:55:52.924 --> 01:55:54.936
JAKE SULLY: TRAITOR
TO HUMANITY

01:56:00.936 --> 01:56:02.420
Guess we got him.

01:56:03.952 --> 01:56:05.412
Make room!

01:56:06.952 --> 01:56:07.952
Luke on.

01:56:09.535 --> 01:56:10.577
Their weapons.

01:56:19.644 --> 01:56:23.974
It's over, Jake.
6 a.m. tomorrow.

01:56:26.926 --> 01:56:30.412
Varang wants your heart,
but I'm keeping it old school.

01:56:30.942 --> 01:56:35.932
Peloton. Selfridge says
it looks better.

01:56:36.742 --> 01:56:38.772
And you're fumbling for your ties.

01:56:40.962 --> 01:56:43.942
It's not about them.

01:56:46.324 --> 01:56:48.317
It's about you and me.

01:56:48.952 --> 01:56:52.381
About a soldier who
abused my trust.

01:56:52.610 --> 01:56:55.634
About the men and
women I lost.

01:57:00.127 --> 01:57:02.325
Memories of a dead man.

01:57:04.948 --> 01:57:07.904
Miles Quaritch is gone.

01:57:08.948 --> 01:57:13.498
You are free, and there is
a whole world out there.

01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:17.881
There are things that ties
will never be able to understand.

01:57:18.958 --> 01:57:22.670
The Na'vi call
it "kame." To see.

01:57:22.835 --> 01:57:26.365
- I know.
- So learn to see.

01:57:26.809 --> 01:57:28.790
Get in touch with something bigger.

01:57:29.151 --> 01:57:32.149
Bigger than anything you
've ever known.

01:57:33.944 --> 01:57:36.099
Then you will see this world.

01:57:38.568 --> 01:57:40.201
Look at yourself.

01:57:44.049 --> 01:57:45.692
I see you -

01:57:46.942 --> 01:57:48.685
- at 6 o'clock.

01:58:43.914 --> 01:58:49.193
- Last time I got two.
- Yes, the ugliest ones in the whole village.

01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:11.381
Hands up against the wall!

01:59:15.904 --> 01:59:17.889
- Like this.
- Close the door.

01:59:29.908 --> 01:59:32.857
It's just one of
Quaritch's scouts.

02:00:02.628 --> 02:00:03.662
Keep an eye on me.

02:00:25.796 --> 02:00:29.796
You have a PhD. How
hard can it be?

02:00:50.019 --> 02:00:52.007
Look there now.

02:00:55.478 --> 02:00:57.454
Hey, beautiful.

02:00:59.892 --> 02:01:01.906
She wants me.

02:01:09.135 --> 02:01:11.149
Quaritch.

02:01:14.842 --> 02:01:18.850
We are the fire. Mangkwan!

02:01:23.908 --> 02:01:27.607
Quaritch! Quaritch!

02:01:29.922 --> 02:01:34.584
Not a sound, witch.
Where's Jake Sully?

02:01:35.138 --> 02:01:37.551
The wife. Loyal to her husband.

02:01:37.889 --> 02:01:40.185
Say it, or I'll cut in.

02:01:43.522 --> 02:01:47.526
Where? I won't ask again.

02:01:49.624 --> 02:01:52.597
No, wait.

02:01:52.912 --> 02:01:56.855
Outside the camp. In an animal cage.

02:01:56.896 --> 02:02:00.853
Take me there. Which way?

02:02:01.159 --> 02:02:02.185
Nasty!

02:02:05.912 --> 02:02:07.857
Come and join us.

02:02:18.210 --> 02:02:22.662
- After her!
- Take her heart!

02:02:35.985 --> 02:02:37.011
Fly!

02:02:53.886 --> 02:02:54.918
Take cover!

02:03:08.898 --> 02:03:10.459
Jake!

02:03:12.302 --> 02:03:14.732
- Madam General...
- I'm busy.

02:03:14.890 --> 02:03:19.904
It's important. The kid's on the loose,
and I have to get him back alive.

02:03:28.963 --> 02:03:29.971
Fuck her.

02:04:22.224 --> 02:04:25.855
Off the field, boys. Move.

02:04:25.896 --> 02:04:27.890
Shoot, shoot!

02:04:29.808 --> 02:04:31.373
Off the field!

02:04:38.733 --> 02:04:39.749
Shovel down.

02:04:46.884 --> 02:04:47.898
Run, Jake.

02:04:51.888 --> 02:04:52.904
I want ham!

02:04:56.419 --> 02:04:57.421
Behind.

02:05:01.319 --> 02:05:02.327
Such.

02:05:06.902 --> 02:05:10.882
- Shoot the cameras!
- Keep up with me.

02:05:18.746 --> 02:05:19.788
Keep up with me.

02:05:25.199 --> 02:05:28.193
What am I doing?

02:05:49.576 --> 02:05:52.576
Is my protest
noted now, assholes?

02:06:00.621 --> 02:06:03.594
- Jake
- this way.

02:06:03.730 --> 02:06:05.740
No, this way.

02:06:09.625 --> 02:06:12.639
Ian Garvin, marine biologist.

02:06:12.878 --> 02:06:18.705
I'm a big fan of everything you
do. I'm a little overwhelmed right now.

02:06:18.894 --> 02:06:22.189
Quiet. What's the plan?

02:06:22.564 --> 02:06:25.478
I haven't thought
further than this.

02:06:25.898 --> 02:06:29.888
Then it's Neytiri. Come on.

02:06:34.513 --> 02:06:36.513
Fly to!

02:06:38.524 --> 02:06:40.158
Fly, fly!

02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:50.671
Why are you doing this?

02:06:50.908 --> 02:06:54.920
They are planning a large-scale
tulku hunt the day after tomorrow.

02:06:55.876 --> 02:07:00.345
- They're putting all the ships in.
- The calf communion.

02:07:02.508 --> 02:07:05.512
You are the only one
who can stop them.

02:07:06.894 --> 02:07:08.416
Come on.

02:07:17.888 --> 02:07:19.920
SATA, SSH.

02:07:22.342 --> 02:07:23.783
Come on.

02:07:30.789 --> 02:07:33.789
Vent. No!

02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:45.278
Hurry away!

02:07:52.657 --> 02:07:56.638
- Lima 16 has captured one.
- Is that Sully?

02:07:57.291 --> 02:08:00.572
- Switch to missiles.
- Switch to missiles.

02:08:01.932 --> 02:08:02.960
Do you remember me?

02:08:05.362 --> 02:08:08.744
Namely, you idiot! I
don't need this.

02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:12.890
What are you going to do? Shoot me?

02:08:14.752 --> 02:08:18.236
It's the air-breather. He's
standing in the firing line.

02:08:18.896 --> 02:08:20.880
He must not shoot!

02:08:21.890 --> 02:08:25.611
Lima 16, the fire is on hold.
Keep him on the grain.

02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:28.486
Send reinforcements out there.

02:08:28.894 --> 02:08:32.728
You don't shoot me,
because you can't.

02:08:33.070 --> 02:08:36.063
In return, you can
kick my ass.

02:08:36.902 --> 02:08:40.888
Come on, Jake. Run, run, run!

02:08:42.886 --> 02:08:46.041
He's running west.
Line of fire still blocked.

02:08:47.455 --> 02:08:49.485
Follow me.

02:08:54.876 --> 02:08:55.876
Follow along!

02:08:56.306 --> 02:08:59.197
That's enough. Lima 16, shoot.

02:08:59.283 --> 02:09:01.134
- No!
- Throw him out.

02:09:01.213 --> 02:09:04.904
- Ignore that order.
- Run, run, run!

02:09:05.216 --> 02:09:10.549
- Lima 16, clear fire.
- I've lost sight of them.

02:09:12.385 --> 02:09:14.721
- He's turning around.
- Come on.

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:19.314
- Blue 1 here. Fire on hold.
- Lima 16, you have the fire clear.

02:09:19.557 --> 02:09:21.557
16 opens fire.

02:09:27.518 --> 02:09:28.528
Down!

02:09:37.892 --> 02:09:39.478
Ma Jake!

02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:40.890
Neytiri!

02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:45.783
Honey, I don't know whether to
kiss you or scold you.

02:09:46.103 --> 02:09:47.486
You're wasting time.

02:09:47.863 --> 02:09:49.525
Hop on.

02:09:51.896 --> 02:09:53.486
Off you go.

02:10:08.008 --> 02:10:10.016
Land anywhere.

02:10:32.717 --> 02:10:34.978
I really need to pee.

02:10:35.725 --> 02:10:38.049
You landed just in time.

02:10:38.713 --> 02:10:42.361
What's up?
Why are we stopping?

02:10:46.745 --> 02:10:50.861
They haven't even put
a zipper in. How stupid.

02:10:51.456 --> 02:10:54.413
Good idea. Drink first,
piss in the water afterwards.

02:10:54.713 --> 02:10:56.708
What's up, Jake?

02:10:57.119 --> 02:11:00.749
I was wrong. We ca
n't protect him.

02:11:02.489 --> 02:11:04.884
It itches like hell.

02:11:05.742 --> 02:11:10.759
Quaritch has a woman who
can find us wherever we are.

02:11:11.408 --> 02:11:14.405
They want to capture him and study him.

02:11:14.751 --> 02:11:18.470
And when humans
can breathe our air, -

02:11:19.111 --> 02:11:22.142
- will they infect our world -

02:11:22.711 --> 02:11:26.697
- and spoil the forests and oceans,
just like they did on Earth.

02:11:27.729 --> 02:11:33.361
The Na'vi people will be exterminated.
The Tulkun will be exterminated.

02:11:34.205 --> 02:11:37.549
And I cannot allow that.

02:11:37.695 --> 02:11:40.697
Are you hungry for dogs too?

02:11:46.146 --> 02:11:47.713
You were right.

02:11:52.725 --> 02:11:54.361
We have to.

02:11:55.708 --> 02:11:57.698
Jake …

02:11:59.390 --> 02:12:01.410
He saved your life.

02:12:12.711 --> 02:12:14.517
There is nothing else for it.

02:12:26.729 --> 02:12:27.741
Spider …

02:12:29.733 --> 02:12:31.064
Come here.

02:12:37.908 --> 02:12:38.938
So what?

02:12:42.326 --> 02:12:43.329
What's wrong?

02:12:43.753 --> 02:12:45.463
Come with me.

02:12:47.929 --> 02:12:49.439
Come on.

02:12:58.737 --> 02:13:02.463
- I have to pee.
- Stay close to me.

02:13:10.755 --> 02:13:14.064
- Where are we going?
- Be quiet.

02:13:29.587 --> 02:13:32.025
Is it something serious?

02:13:44.442 --> 02:13:46.480
Come here.

02:13:50.222 --> 02:13:52.209
It's nice here.

02:13:52.751 --> 02:13:56.002
On your knees. On your knees.

02:13:56.194 --> 02:13:58.164
Get down on your knees!

02:13:58.729 --> 02:14:01.986
Don't. Jake, don't.

02:14:02.575 --> 02:14:05.150
Look straight ahead. Don't move.

02:14:05.346 --> 02:14:08.358
Don't do it. It's
not necessary.

02:14:09.664 --> 02:14:11.599
Don't.

02:14:11.727 --> 02:14:14.322
- Grandma
- are you here?

02:14:15.474 --> 02:14:17.445
It's not necessary.

02:14:17.745 --> 02:14:21.470
Guide my hand. Give me strength.

02:14:21.587 --> 02:14:25.095
Don't! Wo
n't you just stop?

02:14:25.527 --> 02:14:28.025
Don't look at me.

02:14:30.704 --> 02:14:33.574
- Forgive me.
- I'll behave myself.

02:14:33.639 --> 02:14:39.033
May your spirit go to Eywa and
your body return to the forest -

02:14:39.721 --> 02:14:44.753
- to maintain the balance of life.
May the ancestors welcome you.

02:14:59.656 --> 02:15:01.615
Don't.

02:15:01.743 --> 02:15:06.877
May the ancestors embrace
you and sing your song.

02:15:07.433 --> 02:15:12.150
I know I'm going
home to Eywa now. It's okay.

02:15:13.291 --> 02:15:14.745
Men …

02:15:17.451 --> 02:15:19.479
...do you still love me?

02:15:20.745 --> 02:15:22.822
With all my heart.

02:16:06.557 --> 02:16:08.275
Ma Jake!

02:16:19.376 --> 02:16:20.962
I see you.

02:16:28.994 --> 02:16:31.939
Whatever happens,
this is not the solution.

02:16:33.717 --> 02:16:36.408
We will find another solution.

02:16:51.980 --> 02:16:57.345
My father knew deep
down that there was only one path.

02:17:04.392 --> 02:17:09.822
No matter what you imagine yourself
to be as a father or as a husband, -

02:17:10.733 --> 02:17:13.751
- you always turn
it on again.

02:17:33.713 --> 02:17:35.775
Good morning, old friend.

02:17:37.574 --> 02:17:39.602
Toruk loved my father.

02:17:42.283 --> 02:17:48.301
Together they were somewhat larger,
and when they flew, blood sprayed.

02:17:52.183 --> 02:17:53.525
He is coming.

02:18:17.752 --> 02:18:19.881
Toruk Makto!

02:18:22.313 --> 02:18:25.296
No, no, get up.

02:18:25.737 --> 02:18:27.739
Get up.

02:18:28.316 --> 02:18:29.900
Tax …

02:18:31.752 --> 02:18:33.392
It's okay.

02:18:35.731 --> 02:18:39.743
Go out to all the clans within
a day's ride and tell them...

02:18:42.828 --> 02:18:44.838
...that Toruk Makto summons them.

02:18:46.926 --> 02:18:48.774
Tell them -

02:18:50.374 --> 02:18:52.049
- that the day is over.

02:19:31.731 --> 02:19:35.478
And so it was that
Toruk Makto returned, -

02:19:36.056 --> 02:19:39.228
- and my father
reunited the clans.

02:19:39.962 --> 02:19:42.361
He gave great speeches.

02:19:42.589 --> 02:19:45.978
Many arrows together
cannot be broken.

02:19:48.069 --> 02:19:50.075
We cannot be broken!

02:19:58.476 --> 02:20:01.025
But he knew
it wasn't enough.

02:20:19.002 --> 02:20:22.142
Great Matriarch.
Wise Elders.

02:20:24.095 --> 02:20:25.884
The sky people are on their way here.

02:20:26.403 --> 02:20:31.344
Now and here. They are coming to
kill our Tulkun family.

02:20:32.322 --> 02:20:35.709
I beg you.
Fight with us.

02:20:44.069 --> 02:20:45.069
She says:

02:20:45.361 --> 02:20:49.719
"We respect Toruk Makto,
but our customs are ancient.

02:20:53.119 --> 02:20:57.424
We believe that killing
only leads to more killing -

02:20:58.464 --> 02:21:01.205
- in an endlessly
growing spiral."

02:21:03.376 --> 02:21:05.371
Hear my words.

02:21:06.962 --> 02:21:12.142
The sky people will not heal
until the last tulkun is laid down.

02:21:19.762 --> 02:21:20.782
Lo'ak!

02:21:28.415 --> 02:21:30.494
My brother must speak to the council.

02:21:30.891 --> 02:21:33.579
- Be gone, Payakan.
- You're not allowed here.

02:21:33.994 --> 02:21:36.680
- Stop!
- Lo'ak, what are you doing?

02:21:36.721 --> 02:21:38.986
Far, vent.

02:21:39.713 --> 02:21:46.244
- As a tulkun brother, I have the right to speak.
- Lo'ak speaks the truth. Listen to him.

02:21:46.311 --> 02:21:47.681
Tsireya!

02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:57.791
His brother has been ostracized.
You have no standing here.

02:22:00.103 --> 02:22:03.581
If he is an outcast,
I am an outcast too.

02:22:04.666 --> 02:22:08.080
- And I am an outcast.
- Daughter, be quiet.

02:22:08.408 --> 02:22:11.721
No! You'll
never see me again.

02:22:13.368 --> 02:22:17.025
- And I and my brother are outcasts.
- Aonung!

02:22:18.072 --> 02:22:20.741
And we are also outcasts.

02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:35.743
She says you have to talk.

02:22:40.028 --> 02:22:44.064
Hear my words. My brother
went out to protect his native clan, -

02:22:44.285 --> 02:22:49.064
- but his clan had been
wiped out by the demon ships.

02:22:49.720 --> 02:22:53.213
Ta'nok was the
only one who survived because she took up the fight.

02:22:54.657 --> 02:22:56.017
Come closer.

02:23:23.111 --> 02:23:24.471
Ta'nok says:

02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:29.986
"I speak for the dead
mothers and the dead calves."

02:23:35.541 --> 02:23:38.735
I speak for my people
and all our songs...

02:23:41.164 --> 02:23:44.564
...that is gone forever.

02:23:50.283 --> 02:23:54.572
I am the last one. The blind
witness to our doom.

02:24:00.502 --> 02:24:05.737
The customs of the Tulkun must change.
Payakan shows us the way forward.

02:24:13.403 --> 02:24:15.388
We must take up the fight.”

02:24:15.601 --> 02:24:17.597
We must take up the fight!

02:24:34.806 --> 02:24:38.431
- What did she say?
- They're discussing it.

02:24:39.377 --> 02:24:41.344
Take a look.

02:24:41.783 --> 02:24:46.439
There are hundreds of them.
Look how many are old.

02:24:46.650 --> 02:24:50.361
Old is good, because
they grow throughout their lives.

02:24:50.916 --> 02:24:52.861
And that means more amrita.

02:24:53.564 --> 02:24:57.439
Look at this motherfucker. She
must be 100 meters long.

02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:03.039
You're holding the briefing without me.
It must be an oversight.

02:25:03.322 --> 02:25:04.855
No, it's not.

02:25:05.337 --> 02:25:11.369
After the Sully fiasco, you're
done, Colonel. You're under house arrest.

02:25:11.563 --> 02:25:16.540
Forget it. Sully will be there,
and so will Spider.

02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:21.158
The one who also has
one foot in jail.

02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:25.299
- Maybe you'd like to call Dad?
- The chairman of the board?

02:25:26.853 --> 02:25:29.470
I can still
complete the mission.

02:25:29.556 --> 02:25:35.578
You are a disgrace to your uniform.
Do you remember what a uniform is?

02:25:37.032 --> 02:25:39.634
They have block arrest. Permanent.

02:25:56.149 --> 02:25:58.167
- Why are you here
- slut?

02:25:59.876 --> 02:26:01.782
To pray, tsahìk.

02:26:05.876 --> 02:26:07.884
- No
- children.

02:26:11.260 --> 02:26:13.270
Why are you here among us?

02:26:16.372 --> 02:26:19.388
Maybe it was predestined.

02:26:21.907 --> 02:26:26.128
Only one who has been chosen
may invoke the Warrior Mother.

02:26:30.845 --> 02:26:34.455
Tsahìk, you are in labor.

02:26:34.799 --> 02:26:38.642
I fear we
won't survive this.

02:26:43.288 --> 02:26:44.316
Left …

02:26:47.439 --> 02:26:48.865
Hear my words.

02:26:50.064 --> 02:26:53.338
If there's anything
you can do, -

02:26:54.604 --> 02:26:56.614
- then you should do it.

02:26:59.884 --> 02:27:02.427
Your heart is strong.

02:27:03.336 --> 02:27:04.485
Her.

02:27:05.549 --> 02:27:09.150
- Should I ride with you?
- No, you have to stay here.

02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:17.033
I need to know you're safe. Stay at
your post no matter what. Is that understood?

02:27:17.430 --> 02:27:19.439
Lima charlie, far.

02:27:25.547 --> 02:27:30.173
If Dad and I don't come
back, you take Spider and the girls -

02:27:30.482 --> 02:27:33.500
- and run away as
far away as you can.

02:28:20.267 --> 02:28:22.263
Shut up.

02:28:26.658 --> 02:28:29.022
The flux is absolutely insane.

02:28:29.478 --> 02:28:33.783
Keep your distance. That
devil will rip your head off.

02:28:33.987 --> 02:28:35.997
It has been received.

02:28:52.931 --> 02:28:55.879
Okay, boys, let's
have some fun.

02:28:56.912 --> 02:28:59.883
Then the bus runs!

02:29:09.803 --> 02:29:11.807
Submarines in the tub.

02:29:22.046 --> 02:29:25.014
- Yes, please!
- Come on!

02:29:34.095 --> 02:29:35.559
Do you see any enemies?

02:29:35.982 --> 02:29:39.986
No. No activity. And
the animals just do their thing.

02:29:42.366 --> 02:29:44.390
Fish in a barrel, Scoresby.

02:29:44.752 --> 02:29:45.986
Vent.

02:29:49.353 --> 02:29:52.431
Wind, wind…

02:29:53.875 --> 02:29:55.851
Vent.

02:30:04.985 --> 02:30:06.604
Wait a minute.

02:30:07.369 --> 02:30:10.781
There are no bulls and
no large females.

02:30:12.064 --> 02:30:13.663
No adults.

02:30:15.946 --> 02:30:17.067
Stop for a moment.

02:30:18.009 --> 02:30:19.841
I pick up a large signature.

02:30:20.509 --> 02:30:25.689
- Tulkuns, and they are big.
- Many Tulkuns on the way!

02:30:38.712 --> 02:30:41.040
Scoresby, you said
they weren't aggressive.

02:30:41.736 --> 02:30:43.220
They aren't either. Normally.

02:30:45.527 --> 02:30:48.490
Payakan, I'm leading.

02:30:48.704 --> 02:30:51.041
Yes, matriarch.

02:30:55.205 --> 02:30:56.808
I've lost sight of them.

02:31:26.688 --> 02:31:29.056
They're fighting!

02:31:54.033 --> 02:31:55.163
Not!

02:32:24.775 --> 02:32:25.777
Be careful!

02:32:47.806 --> 02:32:50.884
Man your weapons! Fire!

02:33:16.232 --> 02:33:18.713
To port!

02:33:22.566 --> 02:33:24.853
- Leave!
- Watch out!

02:33:57.623 --> 02:34:00.619
- Cool, Jake!
- Bro, look.

02:34:28.939 --> 02:34:30.212
Jake!

02:34:34.330 --> 02:34:35.396
It's the Ash People.

02:34:36.127 --> 02:34:38.843
Furie riders.
More than a hundred.

02:34:39.556 --> 02:34:41.857
These are our allies.
They have IFF tags.

02:34:42.134 --> 02:34:46.611
Now Sully is out of
the woods. I'll do the rest.

02:35:23.204 --> 02:35:25.669
They can't win.

02:35:25.963 --> 02:35:27.554
They are killed.

02:35:29.213 --> 02:35:30.557
Left!

02:35:30.916 --> 02:35:33.150
- Stop her!
- Kiri, stop.

02:35:33.570 --> 02:35:38.408
Come back. You
're in danger out here.

02:35:38.657 --> 02:35:43.616
- I must call upon the Great Mother.
- Not underwater. Then you will die.

02:35:49.499 --> 02:35:51.470
Left, stop!

02:35:51.690 --> 02:35:54.127
- Left!
- Left!

02:35:54.763 --> 02:35:55.787
Come on!

02:35:57.095 --> 02:36:00.189
Piss too. Tuk, you stay here.

02:36:00.947 --> 02:36:02.330
Lo'ak, come on.

02:36:03.134 --> 02:36:05.649
You shouldn't follow me.

02:36:34.941 --> 02:36:36.955
- They're coming.
- Fight with us.

02:36:37.697 --> 02:36:39.986
We must defend the mothers.

02:36:40.407 --> 02:36:43.409
- I'll stay with her.
- Come on!

02:36:57.361 --> 02:37:02.713
Almoder, hear my
words. You must help us.

02:37:04.189 --> 02:37:08.056
I beg you. You
are our only hope.

02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:25.121
We need you.

02:37:26.007 --> 02:37:28.009
You must not reject me.

02:37:32.376 --> 02:37:36.390
I'm begging you. No, please don't.

02:37:44.079 --> 02:37:46.299
No, no, no...

02:37:47.833 --> 02:37:50.796
- Monkey!
- Now we do it.

02:37:51.026 --> 02:37:53.014
Come on!

02:37:54.447 --> 02:37:55.569
Come on!

02:37:56.993 --> 02:37:58.189
Guy!

02:38:13.610 --> 02:38:16.502
I beg you!

02:38:20.057 --> 02:38:23.642
Help us! The people are dying!

02:38:32.295 --> 02:38:34.301
No!

02:38:36.011 --> 02:38:37.984
- Knock!
- Come on.

02:38:39.689 --> 02:38:42.072
Come on! We can do it!

02:38:43.821 --> 02:38:45.825
Sully never gives up.

02:39:03.029 --> 02:39:07.009
- Come on!
- Come on!

02:39:25.717 --> 02:39:29.689
- Grandmother
- help us.

02:39:29.967 --> 02:39:31.967
The people are dying.

02:39:34.037 --> 02:39:38.470
I call upon the Warrior Mother.
You are our only hope.

02:40:38.753 --> 02:40:39.998
Guy!

02:40:55.290 --> 02:40:56.438
After him.

02:41:02.476 --> 02:41:03.830
Lock him up.

02:41:34.074 --> 02:41:38.627
Sa'ata, talented girl.

02:41:54.047 --> 02:41:56.059
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

02:41:57.224 --> 02:41:58.246
Where is Kiri?

02:42:03.771 --> 02:42:06.755
Jake, I've been shot down.

02:42:07.052 --> 02:42:10.050
Hurry to safety.
Do not attack.

02:42:11.884 --> 02:42:13.896
It's over with us.

02:42:16.993 --> 02:42:18.033
The most …

02:42:32.585 --> 02:42:35.728
- Far!
- Lo'ak …

02:42:37.078 --> 02:42:39.108
Don't worry, I got you.

02:42:46.125 --> 02:42:48.113
True!

02:43:00.468 --> 02:43:04.466
- Stay here. I'll save her.
- Don't leave me.

02:43:13.784 --> 02:43:14.792
Sa'ata, wind.

02:43:20.105 --> 02:43:23.107
- I'm dying.
- No, you're not.

02:43:25.033 --> 02:43:27.738
Why do you
always have to be on the opposite side?

02:43:27.905 --> 02:43:31.937
I'm dying, but before then
I push the baby out.

02:43:40.966 --> 02:43:41.984
So pressure!

02:43:44.727 --> 02:43:46.729
I have you.

02:43:52.002 --> 02:43:56.869
- I'll pull it out in three.
- No, wait. The wound needs to be bandaged.

02:44:10.462 --> 02:44:11.502
Left! Left!

02:44:12.071 --> 02:44:14.037
Left!

02:44:22.834 --> 02:44:23.858
Are you okay?

02:44:26.252 --> 02:44:27.713
- It's okay.
- Good.

02:44:29.072 --> 02:44:30.084
Push on!

02:44:35.158 --> 02:44:37.791
One more push.

02:44:38.513 --> 02:44:41.525
She is coming now.

02:44:45.034 --> 02:44:47.014
Take your child.

02:44:52.775 --> 02:44:56.517
So, Neytiri.

02:44:57.424 --> 02:44:59.103
Not.

02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:04.690
What should her name be?

02:45:06.174 --> 02:45:08.334
Her name will be Pril.

02:45:10.878 --> 02:45:12.884
Be strong.

02:45:17.830 --> 02:45:20.184
Pril is a good name.

02:45:21.002 --> 02:45:23.345
Will you protect her?

02:45:24.711 --> 02:45:25.735
Yes.

02:45:48.931 --> 02:45:51.377
Sorry, I left my post.

02:45:51.585 --> 02:45:56.189
It's okay, my boy.
You've proven your worth.

02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:00.406
You made the Tulkuns fight.

02:46:01.346 --> 02:46:04.880
Toruk Makto could
n't do it, but you did.

02:46:06.259 --> 02:46:07.792
I am proud of you.

02:46:39.599 --> 02:46:41.392
Okay, guys.

02:46:42.092 --> 02:46:45.681
Now we're getting
together. Work calls.

02:46:46.228 --> 02:46:47.260
Seriously?

02:46:49.493 --> 02:46:53.564
There's
$100 billion waiting for us in that cove.

02:46:55.859 --> 02:46:57.853
I give beer.

02:46:59.377 --> 02:47:02.508
Your name is Pril.

02:47:02.658 --> 02:47:05.861
Your mother was strong,
and you will be too.

02:47:05.976 --> 02:47:07.982
Fru Sully.

02:47:26.905 --> 02:47:27.921
Spoils of war.

02:47:29.204 --> 02:47:31.363
Father. Father, look.

02:47:43.094 --> 02:47:47.259
I need
you now. By my side.

02:47:47.502 --> 02:47:51.127
- I need my wingman.
- Okay.

02:47:51.268 --> 02:47:53.274
Departure.

02:48:05.189 --> 02:48:09.009
Jake, I know you're out there.
I know you can hear me.

02:48:10.263 --> 02:48:13.247
Varang is going hard on your wife.

02:48:22.023 --> 02:48:25.982
You must surrender
and take Spider with you.

02:48:26.131 --> 02:48:30.915
And I know it's
received. Thank you, honey.

02:48:36.227 --> 02:48:39.247
Picadors, go!

02:48:54.009 --> 02:48:57.228
- They'll catch them.
- Get those heifers under control.

02:49:13.708 --> 02:49:17.700
- 100 meters.
- Get me in firing range.

02:49:23.666 --> 02:49:26.975
Matadors, quietly
and calmly forward.

02:49:28.438 --> 02:49:30.611
- Submarines
- prepare torpedoes.

02:49:31.220 --> 02:49:34.220
- Arm torpedoes.
- Arm 1 to 4.

02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:37.470
- 60 meters.
- Target frame.

02:49:43.956 --> 02:49:45.571
Security.

02:49:48.861 --> 02:49:50.488
Ready to open fire.

02:50:01.559 --> 02:50:02.577
See you!

02:50:17.909 --> 02:50:22.213
Stop the shooting. We
have a problem down here.

02:50:22.762 --> 02:50:26.064
- It's Eywa
- It worked!

02:50:36.455 --> 02:50:38.461
Seek out the sky people…

02:50:39.512 --> 02:50:41.542
...and kill them all!

02:50:47.271 --> 02:50:50.533
- Watch out!
- Get us away!

02:51:11.555 --> 02:51:13.516
Full power!

02:51:13.776 --> 02:51:16.788
All boats back to the ship!

02:51:20.243 --> 02:51:22.481
- Take it
- boat neck!

02:52:19.932 --> 02:52:22.455
- Get us out of here.
- The engine's dead.

02:53:21.775 --> 02:53:23.365
Get it restarted!

02:53:25.030 --> 02:53:27.899
Madam General, the flux
is pulling us in.

02:53:30.621 --> 02:53:33.838
- Abandon the ship.
- Abandon the ship!

02:53:40.126 --> 02:53:41.908
Stay close to me.

02:53:51.899 --> 02:53:53.893
Stay close to me.

02:53:55.357 --> 02:53:57.009
Free lane.

02:53:57.460 --> 02:53:58.482
Free lane.

02:54:03.978 --> 02:54:05.040
Down!

02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:08.603
In the lifeboats! Run!

02:54:14.009 --> 02:54:15.792
I'm going to need covering fire.

02:54:16.330 --> 02:54:20.805
I go left
and behind them.

02:54:20.994 --> 02:54:25.197
Just keep an eye on me. And
don't shoot anyone you love.

02:54:26.130 --> 02:54:28.104
Off you go.

02:54:39.674 --> 02:54:44.001
Colonel, this is Spider.
You must not kill them.

02:54:47.212 --> 02:54:50.222
Where are you? Come forward freely.

02:54:51.849 --> 02:54:53.869
Okay, I'm coming out.

02:55:06.299 --> 02:55:10.525
Spider, can you hear me?
Time is running out.

02:55:24.655 --> 02:55:26.655
True!

02:55:35.017 --> 02:55:36.571
I want to make a trade.

02:55:37.509 --> 02:55:40.694
- Me against them.
- It can be arranged.

02:55:41.157 --> 02:55:44.799
Come with me.
I stand by my word.

02:55:45.006 --> 02:55:49.009
We can solve the matter here and
now, and then everyone can return home.

02:55:58.414 --> 02:56:00.970
Come on, let's go.

02:56:23.672 --> 02:56:24.696
Tuk!

02:56:30.459 --> 02:56:31.963
Knock, Knock!

02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:48.954
Leave my mother alone.

02:56:55.806 --> 02:56:57.541
From here!

02:57:24.203 --> 02:57:26.939
Find your mother and
get her off the ship!

02:57:43.915 --> 02:57:45.611
- Hold on
, kid.

02:58:03.333 --> 02:58:06.365
- Spider, her!
- Spider!

02:58:17.907 --> 02:58:19.933
- Jake!
- Spider!

02:58:32.112 --> 02:58:34.116
Fly, fly!

02:59:09.829 --> 02:59:11.833
Jake!

02:59:30.970 --> 02:59:33.241
I'll kill you!

02:59:34.166 --> 02:59:36.351
Do you want to kill your own father?

02:59:37.384 --> 02:59:39.566
Don't tempt me.

02:59:42.199 --> 02:59:43.221
Give it to me.

02:59:46.736 --> 02:59:48.892
You little brat!

02:59:50.991 --> 02:59:52.767
Come on, Jake.

02:59:54.244 --> 02:59:56.484
Hurry away.

03:01:31.765 --> 03:01:34.439
Jake! Jake!

03:01:41.029 --> 03:01:43.035
My boy!

03:01:44.166 --> 03:01:45.540
Spider!

03:01:48.487 --> 03:01:50.924
Lift him up here!

03:01:54.991 --> 03:01:58.127
- Lift me up!
- Come on!

03:02:00.343 --> 03:02:03.329
If you hadn't
shot me in the arm...

03:02:05.603 --> 03:02:10.174
- I should let you fall.
- Then do it, Dad.

03:02:11.392 --> 03:02:15.375
You're a real thing
. Pull us up.

03:02:39.651 --> 03:02:40.673
Take my hand.

03:02:47.998 --> 03:02:50.976
- Jake!
- Come on.

03:02:52.002 --> 03:02:55.004
We got you. We got you.

03:03:10.477 --> 03:03:13.477
This is awkward.

03:03:19.284 --> 03:03:24.280
So what now? Should we
hold hands and sing?

03:03:25.228 --> 03:03:27.228
Should I learn to see?

03:03:29.197 --> 03:03:31.158
You have the choice.

03:03:43.125 --> 03:03:45.242
Wind! Wind!

03:03:46.017 --> 03:03:48.049
Wind, wind, wind.

03:03:53.559 --> 03:03:55.595
That's a really bad ass.

03:04:20.891 --> 03:04:22.525
Far …

03:04:22.688 --> 03:04:25.674
- Ma Jake, sit down.
- Come here.

03:04:42.038 --> 03:04:44.066
The light always returns.

03:04:55.730 --> 03:04:58.744
We are all
connected to the Great Mother…

03:05:00.998 --> 03:05:04.010
...who loves all his children.

03:05:07.746 --> 03:05:11.455
New life keeps the energy going…

03:05:12.837 --> 03:05:14.744
...like the breath of the world.

03:05:18.009 --> 03:05:23.611
My brother's voice was heard,
and he was incorporated into the clan.

03:05:37.793 --> 03:05:42.803
In the spirit world,
we invoke the strength of our ancestors…

03:05:44.827 --> 03:05:47.843
...from all those who
have walked the path before us.

03:05:59.669 --> 03:06:01.665
- Come on
- Monkey.

03:06:10.572 --> 03:06:12.884
Off. Off.

03:06:21.845 --> 03:06:22.857
Not.

03:06:24.892 --> 03:06:26.891
- I see you.
- I see you.

03:06:27.260 --> 03:06:28.260
Bro!

03:06:29.298 --> 03:06:34.064
Your skxawng. It's
good to see you, little brother.

03:06:36.827 --> 03:06:39.794
Mom, it's Spider.

03:06:40.283 --> 03:06:44.812
I've heard a lot about
you. You're a troublemaker.

03:06:47.595 --> 03:06:50.330
You are alive for the first time, -

03:06:51.033 --> 03:06:56.568
- and your spirit will
live in Eywa forever.

03:06:57.517 --> 03:07:00.783
You are one of us now.

03:07:00.924 --> 03:07:04.324
You are part of the people.

03:07:04.873 --> 03:07:05.901
Fattest.

03:16:50.944 --> 03:16:53.901
YOU ARE NOT ALONE. IF YOU OR
SOMEONE YOU KNOW IS HAVING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, -

03:16:53.942 --> 03:16:57.887
- GO TO FINDAHELPLINE.COM
