1
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,980
-=DA JEONG=-

2
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
Here you go.

3
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,930
Sis, this is too beautiful!

4
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,860
That's why I only order flowers on days you're working, Sis.

5
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,500
Honestly, compared to the boss's creations,

6
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,640
the bouquets you make, Sis, have such a wonderful vibe, just like you.

7
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,310
You can come whenever you want now.

8
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,070
I'm taking over this shop.

9
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,150
-So, are you the boss now, Sis? -Yeah.

10
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,120
Congratulations, Sis.

11
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,750
Hey!

12
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,290
How dare you not pick up my call?

13
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,220
You're going to be late!

14
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,060
Why are you wasting money on those useless flowers?

15
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,630
They're just going to wither anyway.

16
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,129
It's okay. She's my friend.

17
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,130
She just speaks a little harshly.

18
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,340
Hello.

19
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Are you traveling?

20
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,470
Yes, I am.

21
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Where are you going?

22
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,680
I'm going backpacking.

23
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,280
Around Europe.

24
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,450
Then why are you taking flowers to the airport?

25
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,079
It's my mom's birthday today, but I won't be able to attend.

26
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,120
Thank you, sister.

27
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,390
You're welcome to visit again!

28
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,860
Jealous?

29
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Envious?

30
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,860
Envious of what?

31
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,390
Come on out.

32
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
We're going to be late.

33
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,110
Pull yourself together. All your clothes are gone, only that one is left.

34
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,280
Who cares about clothes?

35
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,980
What matters is how much money we can make today.

36
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,220
What are you talking about?

37
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,490
You idiot!

38
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,360
Wow, look at these massive crowds!

39
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,530
This damn mirage, nothing but illusions.

40
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,390
It's the end, it's all over.

41
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,530
I told you, no smoking in the car.

42
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,100
I rolled the window down.

43
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Put it out.

44
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,840
Just one puff, just one.

45
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,500
Put it out.

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,470
Just one drag, come on.

47
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,470
Unbelievable.

48
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,479
I said the car will smell like smoke.

49
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,210
It smelled like smoke even when we bought it anyway.

50
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,610
Seriously, can't you listen? Put it out already!

51
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,150
Give me a bite.

52
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,490
This is crazy.

53
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,690
Hand it over.

54
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,930
Oh my gosh.

55
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,560
Seriously.

56
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,560
Alright, your car is really clean.

57
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,840
Driving like this is too dangerous, isn't it?

58
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,480
This is insane.

59
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Seriously.

60
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,120
I'm amazed every time I come here.

61
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,720
Sister Daobei.

62
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,120
I ate this and lost 7 kilograms this time.

63
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,860
Sure enough, wholesale is more accurate and faster than overseas direct shipping.

64
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,330
If it works so well, then promote it! Spread the word!

65
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,200
For every person you refer, you get a 30% discount, sounds good?

66
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,030
Thirty percent off!

67
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:57,840
Alright, I'll spread the word more.

68
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,939
Thanks for your hard work!

69
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,670
This is natural, truly natural.

70
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,569
Innate.

71
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,840
This is business, it's business.

72
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,940
Let's get moving!

73
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,770
E-seo, time for work.

74
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Daobei.

75
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,710
Did you get a job?

76
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
Get out of the car

77
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,620
Why are you like this?

78
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,419
I asked around. In Dao Bei, we're the top in the capital market.

79
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,620
I'm busy, get out of the car.

80
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,260
Ah, don't! It's cold outside.

81
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,620
This is insane.

82
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,260
Brother, isn't this the type of job you always give me?

83
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,430
Hello?

84
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,060
This one.

85
00:06:58,061 --> 00:06:59,400
This is a clean job.

86
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,829
Then let the young girls handle it. Stop bothering me.

87
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,770
By the way, the police have been investigating everywhere recently.

88
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,269
Now there's no one left. No one!

89
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,670
But Dao Bei, you...

90
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,340
Your identity is squeaky clean.

91
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,650
And even that mall employee has no record.

92
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,750
So, what do you think?

93
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,850
Stop with the nonsense.

94
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,450
I'll pay you double.

95
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,850
Or should I call the police?

96
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,590
Fine, fine.

97
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,960
Alright, spend your whole life running errands then.

98
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,490
Wish you wealth and success.

99
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,570
Ugh, idiot.

100
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,110
Hello.

101
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,589
Rock, paper, scissors

102
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,990
-Rock, paper, scissors -Rock, paper, scissors

103
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,090
Come on!

104
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,000
-Rock, paper -Rock, paper, scissors -Scissors

105
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,370
You can’t drink anymore.

106
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,570
Another miserable day at work.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,770
Hey, she’s eating kimbap while working by the flower shop.

108
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,940
The technique really is different.

109
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,010
Sister.

110
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,910
Go to the shop and treat yourself.

111
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,280
It doesn’t cost much.

112
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Will she go?

113
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,179
E-seul, she...

114
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,450
saves money so aggressively.

115
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,690
She said she’ll quit this line of work by the end of the week.

116
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,659
She’s also taken over the flower shop she was working at part-time.

117
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,730
And got herself a 700-million-won villa too.

118
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,030
Hwa Jin, jealous much?

119
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,770
-If you’re jealous, you lose. -Stop it.

120
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,740
I’m not jealous of Sister E-seul at all.

121
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,340
When she’s gone, I’ll be the top girl.

122
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Nonsense
But sister...

123
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,810
You can’t make much money running a flower shop.

124
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,039
Can you really afford it?

125
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,680
Now I just want to sleep at night and work during the day.

126
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,450
Like a normal person.

127
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,350
Alright, I'm going out for a smoke.

128
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,690
Take it easy.

129
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,950
Thanks.

130
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,390
That thing on Yiseul Unnie's arm...

131
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,629
That blue bracelet for people not going to the afterparty.

132
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,790
It really breaks my heart.

133
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,060
Unnie.

134
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,360
Unnie, you look so ugly today.

135
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,430
Hey!

136
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,270
- You're uglier! - Get lost!

137
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,200
Keep your hands off me.

138
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:20,770
-=On This Day 7 Years Ago=-
You're leaving, Unnie?

139
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,070
What is that?
- =On This Day 7 Years Ago=-

140
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Is that Gayoung Unnie?

141
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,340
Are you doing well, Unnie?

142
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,379
When Gayoung Unnie helped you debut here,

143
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,510
you must have been doing quite well, right?

144
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Right?

145
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,450
You must have been doing really well, right?
 What is it?

146
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,020
Who is it?

147
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,320
The legendary queen of this industry.

148
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,220
It seems she's involved with someone from the Japanese embassy now,

149
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,630
and that's how she makes a living.

150
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,290
No.

151
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,500
It'd be great if we could get some ambassador-level customers in our shop.

152
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,700
I'm not a big fan of government officials.

153
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,430
Foreigners are just so-so.

154
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,240
This guy really doesn't get it.

155
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,710
Ambassadors don't have to go through customs checks.

156
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,270
- When they go shopping for luxury brands, right? - Really?

157
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,310
Stage crew! Stage crew!

158
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,510
Guests arriving in 7 minutes.

159
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,180
Get ready.

160
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,310
Hey, hurry up! The boss gave the order.

161
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,380
You know our boss has been replaced, right?

162
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,350
What? Who's the new boss?

163
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,020
Some rich guy who made a fortune in the Philippines.

164
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,760
Recently came back to Korea, bought up all the shops in Gangnam.

165
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,829
Even this place, along with the role-play rooms.

166
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,930
Today's meeting with the boss has been set.

167
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,529
Supposedly an important meeting with some basketball coach.

168
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,030
Everyone, stay sharp!

169
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,940
The flowerpots at the entrance.

170
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,940
What about them?

171
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,440
They're all wilted.

172
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,610
They're all green except the second one in the front, which is yellow.

173
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,010
If you can't take care of them, toss them out.

174
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,750
Adjust the spacing between the pots too.

175
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,290
Got it.

176
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,650
Go right now

177
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,760
Yes, now? Alright, alright

178
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,730
Please sit

179
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
Boss

180
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,820
Basketball

181
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,020
It's difficult

182
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,820
Basketball is really hard

183
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,090
Even though it looks like a team sport

184
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,260
Depending on when and how you use which player

185
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,730
The outcome can completely change

186
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,870
Don't drag the cup

187
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,340
Boss, you're so sensitive

188
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,710
Get lost

189
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,320
Switch spots with her

190
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,020
Come here and change places

191
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Alright

192
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Boss

193
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,630
That's why an experienced coach like me is needed

194
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,070
And with the star of our team, Han Xu

195
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,570
The game's direction will be entirely under your control

196
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,010
Han Xu listens to everything I say

197
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,510
Boss

198
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,750
Trust me, invest

199
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,390
You little brat, how dare you ignore me

200
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,920
You ill-mannered bastard

201
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,290
65 wins, 59 losses, I memorized them all, you jerk.

202
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,160
What should I do now?

203
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,030
I'm about to make big money.

204
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,730
I'm choosing you.

205
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,099
I'm helping you make big money.

206
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,840
I'm here to turn your life around.

207
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,740
- I'm on your side. - Boss, this way. This way.

208
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,770
Take care.

209
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,350
Hilarious, isn't it?

210
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,480
The same person, who can save whom?

211
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,050
You have to take responsibility for your own life.

212
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,860
Sis, thank you.

213
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,430
-=Wishing you luck=-

214
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,830
Is that really what the boss said?

215
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,400
Oh yay.

216
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,100
What an annoying way to talk.

217
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,140
Oh yay, I made money today.

218
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,280
And I get to ride in Sister Daobei's car!

219
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,380
Get out.

220
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,850
I have an appointment.

221
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,180
Are you really being picky with customers today?

222
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,920
I'll be really hurt.

223
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,890
Ugh, what's wrong with this person?

224
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,990
Hey, clean it up.

225
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,719
Clean the floor!

226
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,760
Ah, really

227
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,460
Hurry up and clean, clean quickly

228
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,660
Seriously

229
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,730
I'm about to quit, treating me like this

230
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,900
Do you know who I just had drinks with?

231
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,499
Basketball coach Choi Chul

232
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,540
The big boss

233
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,970
65 to 59

234
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,710
Win, draw, loss, loss

235
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,180
Bet on that coach's team

236
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,880
This time, really

237
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,420
It's guaranteed to win

238
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:03,090
Sister was there at the time too, ask her if you don't believe me

239
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,290
Hey

240
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,630
Hurry up

241
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,100
Let's go, let's go

242
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,500
Go

243

-=Choi Seung Bae, that bastard, committed suicide! Turns out he was running a rental scam!!!=-

244
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,010
-=Choi Seung Bae, that bastard, committed suicide! Turns out he was running a rental scam!!!=-

245
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,880
Give me back my money, give it back

246
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,530
Damn it, give me back my money

247
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,530
Yi Seol, sister

248
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,229
Sister, you signed the villa contract with Manager Choi, right?

249
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,830
Aren't you moving this week?

250
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,440
Take a look at this, it's correct, right?

251
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,210
Said they sold all the Central China market shares

252
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,780
Doesn't want to live anymore

253
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,080
Does anyone know where that jerk Chief Choi is right now?

254
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,579
-=Funeral Guide In Memory of Choi Seung-Bum (Male, 31 years old)=-
This was all planned

00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,620
-=Funeral=-

256
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,399
Selling cheap villas to women like us

This is bait

258
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,290
Sis

259
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,910
They're gambling with the women's money

260
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,170
That guy really died, huh

261
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,820
Hey

262
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,530
What are you doing?

263
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,980
What are you doing? Get up

264
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,770
Get out

265
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,100
Get out

266
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,420
Get out! Get out!

267
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,809
You two crazy women, at someone else's funeral

268
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,220
What's all this?

269
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,700
Damn

270
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Sis
Wait a second

271
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,360
Enough

272
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,980
Let go

273
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,489
Let go

274
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,589
Let go and then we'll talk

275
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,590
Enough

276
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,240
Enough

277
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,340
You have to survive no matter what

278
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,530
Hold on with the flower shop's balance

279
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Hey

280
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,530
Did you drink with Boss Tu today?

281
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:08,849
What's going on?

282
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Forget it

-=Transferred 100 million won=-

284

Damn it

285
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,180
Hey, come sit down

286
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,780
Damn it

287
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,039
You scared me

288

Daojing

289
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,230
Why is there no money in the account?

290
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,880
Did you bet it all here?

291
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,580
Sit down

292
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,959
Are you crazy?

293
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,369
I said sit down

294
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,370
What now

295
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,340
Look

296
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:11,560
Look at what? At what?

297
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,389
I bet they'll lose

298
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,370
If they lose by 6 points, we win

299
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,980
What nonsense are you talking about

300
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,270
This match is a guaranteed win

301
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,650
So how much lower are you planning to sink?

302
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,630
I'm doing this to avoid sinking lower!

303
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,350
Have you ever seen me bet this much money before?

304
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,269
Damn it, seriously.

305
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,450
You know, this is solid intel.

306
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,430
You heard what Boss Tu and the basketball coach said back then.

307
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,090
Really, what do we do? What do we do?

308
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,170
See? It's guaranteed to profit 100%.

309
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,239
It's almost over.

310
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,390
We just need to keep it at 65 to 59.

311
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,060
A six-point gap and it's over.

312
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,409
65 to 59, Coach Choi Cheol puts player Lee Han-seok in.

313
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,410
Now it's down to the decisive moment.

314
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,950
He entered the court later than expected.

315
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,870
Player Lee Han-seok substitutes player Hong Dong-min.

316
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,269
Lee Han-seok shoots, goes for a three-pointer.

317
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,229
Missed it. Failed.

318
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,899
This substitution timing was a bit late.

319
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,290
So the player seems a bit pressured.

320
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,220
No, no, off-target.

321
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,850
Lee Han-seok makes his move.

322
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,550
-Lee Han-seok goes for the shot. -Off-target.

323
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,830
Missed it.

324
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,290
Unbelievable.

325
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,210
Wow, unbelievable.

326
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,870
Amazing

327
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,860
Hello, hello, hello, did it work?

328
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,460
-YES -Did it work?

329
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,730
What's going on?

330
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,540
It worked.

331
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,000
It worked, it worked.

332
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,080
Did it work?

333
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,450
Hey, I told you it would work, right?

334
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,920
I can handle it in one go.

335
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,030

336
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080

Thank you.

338
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,370
-=Congratulations on being selected! Please claim your prize=-

339
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,940
Just need to exchange the money.

340
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,830
What's going on?

341
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,730
What's wrong?

342
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,130
What's wrong? Don't joke around.

343
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,400
-=From now on, all dine-and-dash payments are guided=-

344
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,770
What's wrong? Is something up?

345
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,810
The thing we talked about last time, can it still be done now?

346
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,090
Thing.

347
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,790
What thing?

348
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,970
I'm asking if the thing we talked about last time can still be done now.

349
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,740
I heard you and Yise wasted all the money.

350
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,199
People are saying you insisted on retiring for appearances and ended up in a mess.

351
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,050
What about you guys?

352
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,840
Triple the amount we discussed last time.

353
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Then I'll do it.

354
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,010
Tonight at 9.

355
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,190
Meeting at that pretty boy's house.

356
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,660
This way, this way.

357
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,260
Is this what you want?

358
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,040
Everyone's busy.

359
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,030
Is it fun?

360
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,460
Brother.

361
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
Yi-seo
This is...

362
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,469
the childhood friends who do business with my brother.

363
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,830
And that's Representative Ahn Jun-min, whom my brother is currently serving.

364
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,600
He said he's inexperienced, so I brought him here and helped him out.

365
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,470
How's the representative? She's the ace of aces in this place.

366
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,140
But her family is ruined.

367
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,960
Just a pretty-faced fool.

368
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,420
Alright, alright, got it. Go on in.

369
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,330
Sis, move aside.

370
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,650
Get out.

371
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,959
- You stepped on me! - Sorry.

372
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,240
Hurry and get out.

373
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,450
- Got it. - Brother.

374
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,219
Brother wants to introduce Yi-seo to a good business opportunity.

375
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,430
That's why he arranged this.

376
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Representative

377
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Representative

378
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,540
How is it?

379
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,690
Pretty amazing, right?

380
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,780
Yi Seol, your brother and these brothers here

381
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,760
No matter if it's storeroom roleplay or nude content

382
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,110
We'll help you debut.

383
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,049
It's okay, lose the money, don't worry.

384
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,200
Just make sure you're prepared.

385
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,450
Yi Seol

386
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,270
You need to wear the red bracelet and move to the second round.

387
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,280
Live within your limits with a clear view of reality.

388
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,250
Isn't that right?

389
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,390
I'm leaving now, kids, Representative.

390
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,869
Enjoy yourselves, and serve the brothers well.

391
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,050
This place is quite thrilling.

392
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,920
I might not be able to come here for a while.

393
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
So suddenly?

394
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,200
My husband's company is undergoing a tax investigation.

395
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,920
He secretly transferred cash to some place in Gyeonggi-do.

396
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,170
I have no money.

397
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,240
I can't come here.

398
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,270
Big trouble has come my way.

399
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,050
What nonsense is this all of a sudden?

400
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,780
Are you saying this is the end for us?

401
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,130
Darling

402
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,960
Let's meet quietly alone outside.

403
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,610
People like us

404
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,990
get monitored when meeting outside.

405
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,300
Sis, didn't you say you were broke? Can you handle this?

406
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,830
Hey, you pretty boy!

407
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,890
How much is the time I spent with you worth? How much of it comes from arguments?

408
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,240
Put out that cigarette, you brat!

409
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,020
Got it.

410
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,390
I understand.

411
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,520
Meeting outside is fine.

412
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,790
But sis, your husband...

413
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,990
How much did he move around that he can't come here?

414
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Sungwon.

415
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,020
Get a grip.

416
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,770
Just follow my instructions.

417
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,600
As soon as money is mentioned...

418
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,090
Damn it.

419
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:40,110
You two pretty boys, made a lot of money, huh?

420
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,619
Has it been a while since you received anything?

421
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,130
Stop messing around, it's about to gather cobwebs.

422
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,859
Brother, have you come in person?

423
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,649
There's a business meeting.

424
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,529
Also, to ensure customer arrangements are safe.

425
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,549
I don't like sleazy businessmen.

426
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,510
I'm giving you a chance.

427
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:56,920
It'd be great if we could cut down on those loan shark fees.

428
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,830
Are you trying to get me killed by that tycoon?

429
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,369
You idiot. Whether you die this way or that way,

430
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,539
if you're taking the last ride, shouldn't you at least travel first class?

431
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,700
Damn it.

432
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,880
Hey, light me a smoke and fill me in on the details.

433
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
Bro.

434
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,460
My sugar mama's husband is that local tycoon.

435
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,870
I heard that tycoon...

436
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,300
...hid secret funds somewhere in Gyeonggi Province.

437
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,180
Bro, you should handle it.

438
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,670
You're serious about this.

439
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,230
I'll gather the intel.

440
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,590
If you handle it, I'll give you 60%.

441
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,420
Okay.

442
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,050
OK.

443
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
I'll contact you.

444
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,899
Keep it up, pretty boy.

445
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,710
This is all I need.

446
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
We meet again.

447
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,310
Come sit next to me.

448
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,580
This is double the price.
- =9:30 PM, Seolleung-ro 172-gil 17=-

449
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,129
Handle this job well.

450
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,800
Thanks to you, Bro, I can finally make some money.

451
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,620
Be careful on the road.

452
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,710
A glass of soju costs two million won.

453
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,090
In a capitalist market,

454
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,590
this is true romance.

455
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,180
Spend another two million won

456
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,510
to have another drink?

457
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,430
Sis, I'm leaving, sis.

458
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,490
Sis, sis.

459
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,340
Help me out.

460
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,790
Hurry up, hurry up.

461
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,860
Sis.

462
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
Get up, hurry.

463
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,320
Get up, damn it, get up.

464
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:52,130
What should we do if we can never see our lovely Sungwon again?

465
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:57,600
I might be able to quit milk shots, but I can't quit you.

466
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,240
Sis, but...

467
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,690
About what you said, can you give it to us?

468
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,150
That... What is that?

469
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,850
The money your husband hid.

470
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,190
If we had that money, we could meet outside too.

471
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,690
Sis, tell me honestly. I know you know where that money is hidden.

472
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,330
I don't know.

473
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,050
What are you doing?

474
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,390
I don't know.

475
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,750
You must have some idea, right?

476
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,360
Got it, got it. I really love you. I love you.

477
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,800
I love you. I love you.

478
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:43,300
My husband bought some land in Gyeonggi Province.

479
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:49,430
So the place where 700 million won in cash is buried is...

480
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,640
Wait, wait, stop the car!

481
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,320
Sis, are you okay? Sis, are you okay?

482
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,550
Sis, are you okay?

483
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,150
-=Seok-gu, I’ll be ready to start immediately
Once you find out where it’s hidden, contact me immediately. The effects are kicking in.=-

484
00:29:28,151 --> 00:29:29,310
Once you find out where it’s hidden, contact me immediately.

485
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,019
I’ll be ready to start immediately.

486
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,400
-=Seok-gu! Ah! Today, our Yiseul is filming her debut work. Let’s look forward to it!=-

487
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:38,090
Today, our Yiseul is filming her debut work. Let’s look forward to it!

488
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,770
Should we try it again?

489
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,720
Hey! Dammit, where are you going?

490
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,610
Ouch, ow!

491
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,500
Almost there, almost there.

492
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
It’s okay, it’s okay.

493
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,960
Didn’t you say you had a headache? Let’s rest here for a bit.

494
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,080
Let’s create some art together.

495
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,140
It’s okay, it’s okay.

496
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,880
-Let me go, damn it! Let me go! -It’s okay.

497
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,010
I let you go. Damn it!

498
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,470
Don’t cross the line just because you’re a fan.

499
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,210
Don’t ruin the mood.

500
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,530
Give me a cigarette.

501
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,610
Shi Jiu plans to steal the dirt boss's money.

502
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,490
700 million in cash.

503
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,590
Same amount as what we lost.

504
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,810
I’ll steal that money to repay your debt.

505
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
So don’t worry.

506
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,240
That dirt boss really isn’t someone you mess with.

507
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,830
We might even end up dead.

508
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,070
Didn’t you say we have to survive no matter what?

509
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,010
Can you keep doing this for another four years?

510
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,540
Let’s do it together.

511
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,110
I’ll investigate the dirt boss’s background.

512
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,840
Could Shi Jiu have already taken it all for himself?

513
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,380
So what’s your plan?

514
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,430
We need to make him drop his guard.

515
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,280
So all of those are the dirt boss’s stores, right?

516
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:54,690
Yeah, you need to be careful of that woman beside the dirt boss.

517
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,320
Her name’s Huang Niu, she’s the dirt boss’s backup.

518
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,580
If she sets her sights on you,

519
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,360
You’ll either become half-witted or disappear completely.

520
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,330
I’m heading out.

521
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:11,600
Mi Seon, be very cautious and make sure your face isn’t exposed.

522
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Got it.

523
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:51,060
Here it is. Damn it, dirt boss, stop wasting time!

524
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,620
Damn.

525
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,740
Such a pain to deal with, absolutely unbearable.

526
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,210
Boss, why are you so hard to please?

527
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,980
But it's really the same here as last time.

528
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,750
No matter how much you drink, you don't get drunk. Don't you think that's strange?

529
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,760
I wonder if it's because the people here are so good-looking.

530
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,480
The more you drink, the hotter it gets.

531
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,029
-Boss, you're here. -Hi.

532
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,030
Hello.

533
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,350
What's left from last time.

534
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,920
Sexy whiskey, sexy ladies.

535
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,110
I'll get it ready and sent to you as soon as possible.

536
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:29,040
-You've gotten prettier. Hurry up. -Ah, boss, you're really...

537
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,600
How can you look even prettier after just two days?

538
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,989
Excuse me, may I sit here?

539
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:52,070
Mm, welcome, welcome.

540
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,449
Welcome, welcome.

541
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,550
Looks like you're wearing black lingerie.

542
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,090
-It's a black panther, really too... -Good evening.

543
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,650
I like you, approved.

544
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,230
Be my wife tonight. Drink up.

545
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,630
Pour me a drink.

546
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,130
Seriously, you're really strange.

547
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,740
Do you have OCD? Honestly, OCD.

548
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,740
If someone touches your things randomly,

549
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,460
do you immediately freak out and can't stand it?

550
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,890
If someone touches my stuff, I just feel overjoyed.

551
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,210
Touch me, touch me.

552
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,940
You, go ahead and choose yourself.

553
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,940
Ah, you really are like this.

554
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,629
How can you treat a lady this way?

555
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,320
How could you do this to our panther?

556
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,240
I'll be the Dark Knight, you take my drink.

557
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,900
Who cares about you, you stingy fellow.

558
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,960
So rich, yet so annoying.

559
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,440
You're buying today, go ahead, treat us.

560
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,459
Wasn't there that villa with skyrocketing prices?

561
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,340
And you even took out Manager Choi.

562
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,640
Got it.

563
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,220
Let's run away, let's escape.

564
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,340
Let's play together, honey. Let's go out and have fun.

565
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,560
Perfect.

566
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,440
The show's starting, honey.

567
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,060
Take off the mask.

568
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,940
Why?

569
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:55,410
Drinking with a masked woman makes the drink tasteless.

570
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,980
I think drinking with a mask on would be more interesting.

571
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,160
Am I drinking just to make you feel entertained?

572
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,100
How about we take turns having a drink now?

573
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,000
If I lose, I'll take off the mask.

574
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,200
I'm going to keep an eye on that shady boss.

575
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,530
Hack into his phone and get the location data.

576
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:55,970
30 minutes

577
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,780
Solve it within 30 minutes

578
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,830
Or I'll take action

579
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,200
Boss, sorry

580
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,390
Are you the car owner?

581
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,640
Sorry, I accidentally hit your car while driving out earlier

582
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,970
Such an expensive car, I damaged it

583
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,740
I'll handle it through car insurance as soon as possible

584
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,870
Forget it

585
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,120
Wait, I didn't see a phone number left in front either

586
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,160
Give me your contact information then

587
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,290
It's fine

588
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,580
Don't regret it later and say something different; hurry and process it through insurance

589
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,990
I already said it's fine, now leave

590
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,630
Damn it

591
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,900
What a terrible attitude

592
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,700
Don't regret it later and say something different, jerk

593
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,760
I certainly have no objection

594
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,640
He's really reliable in handling things

595
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,040
Answers whatever you ask

596
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,479
Among the land bought by the local boss

597
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,440
There's a piece intended for the private cemetery business

598
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,159
Got the hint, right?

599
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,360
You noticed it, didn't you?

600
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,600
You noticed it, didn't you?

601
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,760
It's the Sky Cemetery over in Wangsan, Gyeonggi-do.

602
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,599
Because they were in a rush to relocate.

603
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,760
There’s no surveillance or anything.

604
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,960
Where are you going?

605
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,639
So tired.

606
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,760
Are you sure it’s here?

607
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,919
That’s a soil compactor.

608
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,239
It must be here.

609
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,520
Stop talking and start digging.

610
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,200
Damn.

611
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,520
There’s something.

612
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,720
Damn.

613
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Wait a second.

614
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,120
There’s more underneath.

615
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,960
They said it was 700 million won in cash.

616
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,560
700 million?

617
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,520
This is worth billions of won.

618
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,960
Unbelievable.

619
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,480
This is the hard-earned money of people like us.

620
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,079
We can take it.

621
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,160
True.

622
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,400
Director Choi’s backer is probably a land tycoon, right?

623
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,880
Even if we take half, they won’t let us go.

624
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,320
If we’re going to do it, let’s go all the way.

625
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,560
Right?

626
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,720
Be thorough.

627
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,800
Idiot.

628
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,680
What?

629
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,040
You vile woman.

630
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,120
-=Socket=-

631
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,240
It's a call.

632
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,000
Damn, what do I do?

633
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,280
What now?

634
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,040
Give him 700 million won.

635
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,760
Why give him 700 million won?

636
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,880
Trust me.

637
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,560
Just leave it to me.

638
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,440
You vile woman.

639
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,520
Damn.

640
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,280
Open the door.

641
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,520
Open the door.

642
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,480
Stealing my money is fun, huh?

643
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,999
-What money? What money? -You vile woman.

644
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,640
What money? Isn't it right here?

645
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,400
You're really bold.

646
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,200
-Open it. -Where are you going?

647
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,680
Yoon Mi-seon.

648
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,200
You clamped my leg, you vile woman.

649
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,640
You vile woman, are you on drugs?

650
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,120
Let go.

651
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,360
Let go

652
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,920
Let go

653
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,600
Crazy! Let go!

654
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,240
Die, bastard!

655
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,720
Are you even human?

656
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,840
You nasty woman!

657
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,080
Damn it!

658
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,920
Hey, Daobei!

659
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,200
Daobei!

660
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,559
I'll ruin your hand today!

661
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,920
No!

662
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,040
Stop!

663
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,760
Take it all! Get lost, bastard!

664
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,400
Don't become my enemy.

665
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,440
Idiot!

666
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,640
Hey, Daobei, be careful when choosing your partners!

667
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,880
I'm leaving.

668
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,560
You filthy beggars!

669
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,480
Wish you all got rich!

670
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,760
Beggar!

671
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,600
Idiot!

672
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,080
He's absolutely hilarious.

673
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,960
Are you insane?

674
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,080
Either way, seven billion won is being taken.

675
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,800
Why add action scenes?

676
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,440
If I do this, he won't suspect a thing.

677
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,520
That fool still thinks there's only seven hundred million.

678
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,520
He has to believe us for us to survive.

679
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,760
It's done.

680
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,239
-=Your grave was dug up, your wife knows who the thief is=-

681
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,280
When the mining boss was chasing Shiju.

682
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,520
We need to leave here with the gold.

683
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,320
What should be done with these?

684
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,840
Cui Jiaying.

685
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,920
Go find mom.

686
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,480
I forgot there's no food at home.

687
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,200
Want to eat kimchi fried rice?

688
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,520
Where's the kimchi?

689
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,760
You all love kimchi fried rice, don't you?

690
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,280
I mash the kimchi in the pan.

691
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,639
Add rice.

692
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,560
Add oyster sauce.

693
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,680
Put the scissors away.

694
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,840
So rude.

695
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,920
Mom.

696
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,440
We have a favor to ask you.

697
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,240
Please help us.

698
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,160
Tell me the weakness of that Japanese ambassador you set up.

699
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,240
Let me know.

700
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,440
His weakness.

701
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,080
What should we do? We truly love each other.

702
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,960
Do I look like I'm joking?

703
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,400
Does it look like I'm joking?

704
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,160
Lee Do-jing.

705
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,800
When I was fifteen, I endured the pain to give birth to you.

706
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,600
Betrayal.

707
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,040
500 million won.

708
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,840
I'll give you 500 million won.

709
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,320
Help me deliver a package to Japan.

710
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,920
Give me triple, then I'll do it.

711
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,440
Fine, I'll give you triple.

712
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,360
But I can't give it to you now.

713
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,080
Once you go to Japan, I'll send it immediately.

714
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,640
Looks like big trouble has happened.

715
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,399
This is expensive.

716
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,840
Really expensive.

717
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,920
Go here first to get a new passport.

718
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,920
Running won't work with your current name
- =54 Nonhyeon-ro 272-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul=-

719
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,640
How do you even know about a place like this?

720
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,720
You guys leave. I want to leave, too.

721
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,320
Why are you sitting here alone?

722
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:17,630
Don't bother with Ji-young.

723
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:22,180
Just pack up what you need to take.

724
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,640
And don't have any more ties with her.

725
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,040
The first time I came to a rest area...

726
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,140
I felt independent, grown up, and really happy.

727
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:47,800
When I went to Seoul with my mom.

728
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,500
At that time, it felt like going to study abroad, and I was very happy.

729
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,780
In the rest area, my mom said she wanted to adopt me as her daughter.

730
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,160
She wanted us to live together.

731
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,730
At that moment.

732
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,410
I felt like I had family for the first time.

733
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,330
So I was really happy, you brat.

734
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:42,520
But mom was quite fair, after all.

735
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:44,270
Do you still remember?

736
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,300
How she cut the towel in half for me to use.

737
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:10,390
-=Breathing heavily in a life that fell into a deliberately set trap, sensing death=-

738
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,810
Starting with bird's nest.

739
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:36,870
Spare me.

740
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,140
Throw her out.

741
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,680
Mom.

742
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:28,800
Mom, let me draw for you.

743
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,500
Our family's Misun.

744
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:44,570
Mom, do you remember?

745
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:49,080
On my first day at work.

746
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,330
You helped me put on eye makeup.

747
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:00,440
You said my eyes needed to look beautiful.

748
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,470
Mom preferred one thing more.

749
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,580
Misun, you.

750
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:21,250
Dojing, that brat, will only understand me after I'm gone.

751
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,150
Mom.

752
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,690
Don't drink alcohol after taking sleeping pills.

753
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:35,230
Got it?

754
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,840
-=Let's meet=-

755
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:48,770
Hey, the Ambassador contacted me.

756
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:50,810
I'll be quick.

757
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,110
Lee Do-gyeong.

758
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,080
Get Mom's passport ready.

759
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:03,010
Do you understand?

760
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,120
Don't drive your car. Seok-gu knows our vehicle.

761
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:10,100
Mom is asleep. We need to hurry now.

762
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,700
I'm leaving.

763
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,450
The condition is deleting the video.

764
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:24,260
Let me help you move a package to Japan.

765
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:27,330
Why should I trust you?

766
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:30,050
Then who do you want to trust now?

767
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:32,390
A woman like you,

768
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:35,830
if I agree to one thing, there'll be no end to it.

769
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:38,420
So I changed my approach.

770
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,990
Which is not agreeing to anything from the start.

771
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:51,950
You won't even accept a tax investigation.

772
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,390
You certainly have a lot of reservations.

773
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:58,790
Hey, the original video...

774
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:00,730
Delete it first.

775
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:05,130
If we can't go to Japan anyway, we're all dead.

776
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,830
This video can spread in an instant.

777
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:09,490
Oh my god.

778
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:11,970
You crazy woman.

779
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,860
This is a private account.

780
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,410
Only I can see it.

781
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:32,850
Anything you need?

782
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Who are you?

783
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,760
Whoever's secretly involved with the boss's wife, step forward.

784
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,540
Today, I chose you.

785
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:57,230
Is it you?

786
01:00:58,110 --> 01:00:59,110
Damn.

787
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:25,070
Hello?

788
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:28,710
I told you to stop calling me, idiot.

789
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:32,080
Take care of your own life.

790
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,330
Why aren’t you saying anything?

791
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:04,170
Damn.

792
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:07,340
Where are you?

793
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,710
What is that? What is that?

794
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,119
Scum like you dying today would be a good thing.

795
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,970
Good thing my ass, damn it!

796
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,680
Fine, fine, fine, I’ll talk!

797
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:22,630
I didn’t come here for fortune-telling.

798
01:02:22,631 --> 01:02:24,740
I know, you’re not here for that.

799
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:27,030
You’re here to take the boat, aren’t you?

800
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,080
Take a seat.

801
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:47,750
The Central Market is a place full of dark energy, you know.

802
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,470
Places with strong dark energy

803
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,220
attract people like us.

804
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,680
Even though I don't know what secrets you have,

805
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:02,360
leaving by boat won't change the world.

806
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:08,170
How many people do you need it for?

807
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,330
Write down the names of the people needing passports.

808
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:05,400
It's bad enough a bunch of cockroaches are tangled up with my wife,

809
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,330
but damn, they even dared to touch my money!

810
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,380
We middlemen are impulsive by nature.

811
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:32,750
Before I even finished listening, I cut off that cockroach's tongue too!

812
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:35,130
But,

813
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,020
because I mentioned your name late...

814
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:39,750
Boss.

815
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:44,030
I think... you might have misunderstood something.

816
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,720
This time, don't cut off his tongue right away.

817
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,410
Didn't you already take the money?

818
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:50,840
There's no need to go that far, right?

819
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:51,850
Just slash his thigh.

820
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:01,930
Calm down, calm down!

821
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,510
Spare my life!

822
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,380
I swear I didn't even see it; it's true!

823
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:09,210
Go on.

824
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,460
Yoo Mi-sun, Yoo Mi-sun!

825
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,200
Lee Do-jung.

826
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,300
Ryu Mi-sun, Lee Do-kyung.

827
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,960
They were the ones who stole it.

828
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:16,029
They are thieves.

829
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:19,950
I... I only had the intention, but not the courage.

830
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:25,470
People can always have dreams, right?

831
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:29,600
I know both of them very well.

832
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:33,060
I can be an obedient dog,

833
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:36,880
to help you catch them.

834
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,500
No, no, no.

835
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,540
- Cut it off. - No!

836
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,980
The flight to Japan is the day after tomorrow.

837
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:52,110
Where is the passport?

838
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:57,970
Damn it, the car!

839
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:38,040
- The weather is too good. - Choi Ga-young.

840
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,750
You actually took that?

841
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,110
Right?

842
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:43,020
Where is the stuff?

843
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,980
Do-kyung, Mom retired today.

844
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,450
If you swallow this money whole, you're going to get diarrhea.

845
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,620
You just wait for me.

846
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:52,320
I'm going to kill you, damn it!

847
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,470
Today is going to be very sexy.

848
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,440
Oh, right, Ant.

849
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:11,380
Should I tell you where the gold is?

850
01:07:11,381 --> 01:07:13,410
Do you even know what kind of gold that is, that you dared to take it?

851
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:16,210
A secret only you and I know

852
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,880
What nonsense are you talking about

853
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:26,660
Let's play the role of mom

854
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:29,430
Action

855
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:32,360
Where do we find it now

856
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,870
I understand Choi Ji-young

857
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:37,970
She's definitely not leaving this Central Market

858
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:43,780
Wasn't she reported missing

859
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:45,380
What should we do

860
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:47,150
Really satisfied with this hairstyle

861
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,720
But our star employee has become a missing person

862
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:51,150
Not my problem

863
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,480
What's that

864
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:54,990
A distinguished guest has arrived

865
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:57,760
Hurry and come out to greet them properly

866
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,160
-Yes -Alright

867
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,160
Amazing

868
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,729
Doesn't even need a word

869
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:05,860
They're all legendary treasures

870
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:06,670
Go on, greet them

871
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:09,170
Hello there

872
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:11,600
Hey, greet them properly

873
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,510
Hello, sister, I'm Jaebin Number 1

874
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:14,810
I'm really good at singing

875
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:15,940
Sister, I'm Yeongjae

876
01:08:16,069 --> 01:08:17,069
Number 2

877
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,180
Hello, sister
I'm Yeon-sik

878
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:29,760
-=Jung-kyu! A woman holding gold bars came to the shop=-
Hyung

879
01:08:29,761 --> 01:08:31,289
A woman holding gold bars came to the shop

880
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:32,160
-=Hyung! A woman holding gold bars came to the shop. Gold bars? A young woman?=-

881
01:08:32,161 --> 01:08:35,159
-=Not that young. A bit stale, with a slightly sour tone=-
Not that young, a bit stale

882
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,630
And a slightly sour tone

883
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:42,529
I said I'd become an obedient dog, didn't I?

884
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,220
No

885
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:13,029
Sister

886
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,200
Here, it's here

887
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:15,830
Just go in from here

888
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:19,270
Go in from this side

889
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:38,720
Wait outside

890
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:40,319
Room S, in Room S

891
01:09:42,529 --> 01:09:44,100
They might escape through the back door

892
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:45,700
I'll wait at the back door

893
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,080
Drink, drink

894
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:09,890
Everyone out

895
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:23,430
Who is this?

896
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:08,610
Gold

897
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:11,120
Take me to your master

898
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,020
Gold

899
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,420
Why am I talking to a dog?

900
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:21,530
Choi Ga-young

901
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,200
Come out quickly

902
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,100
Hurry up, hurry up

903
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,720
Let go

904
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,590
Snap out of it and live your life properly

905
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:53,990
Do you even know where this is before you run in?

906
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:56,400
Who's saving who here?

907
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:58,200
Everyone should save their own life

908
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:03,700
So weak

909
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,940
My Daijing is just too weak

910
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:09,910
Li Daojing

911
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:13,910
I'm Cui Jiaying

912
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,590
And I won't live like this

913
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:27,230
I'll live my own way

914
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,160
Go

915
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,160
Go find the gold

916
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,640
I'm abandoning you now

917
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:40,770
Go

918
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:44,510
Go on

919
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,060
Stop right there

920
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,930
You filthy woman

921
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:11,700
You filthy woman

922
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,440
Crying?

923
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,140
Crazy woman

924
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,380
Got scolded by your mom?

925
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:19,680
Filthy woman, where's your mom?

926
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:22,080
Where's your mom?

927
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:23,210
I'm asking you.

928
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:27,250
Damn, filthy woman.

929
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,870
Bring me the gold.

930
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:56,750
Where is mom?

931
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:58,250
I think I know where the gold is.

932
01:13:58,750 --> 01:13:59,420
Let's go quickly.

933
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:02,190
What are you talking about? Didn't I tell you to bring Choi Jae Young?

934
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,260
I don't care anymore.

935
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,030
Once I find the gold, I'll leave this place.

936
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:08,630
Let's go.

937
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:13,530
What are you doing?

938
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:16,030
We need to leave with mom together.

939
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,800
Well, figure it out yourself then.

940
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:21,440
I'm going to do it my way anyway.

941
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,330
Hold tight.

942
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,660
This is your lifeline.

943
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:26,240
It's going to slowly solidify now.

944
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,880
Where's the gold?

945
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:33,510
Get me out of here.

946
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:36,520
Free me and I'll lead the way.

947
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:38,780
Wrong answer.

948
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:40,490
If I tell you,

949
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:43,660
Won't you just kill me right now anyway?

950
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:07,980
You're laughing?

951
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,480
Fun, right?

952
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:18,820
With this,

953
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:22,430
even memories you forgot can come back.

954
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Central Station

955
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:34,670
Locker

956
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:36,810

Please try again.

965
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,500
Central Station locker No. 12, go check it out.

966
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,640
Go check it out.

967
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:08,370
Password
Pass...

968
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:11,310
The secret is...

969
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:57,990
You've worked hard all along.

970
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,710
Damn, it's so filthy.

971
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,200
Look quickly.

972
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:49,570
I found this gold.

973
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,240
I tried entering my birthday as the password.

974
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:55,340
It showed an error.

975
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:58,610
I even entered your password.

976
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,680
That's still wrong.

977
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:02,580
Do you know what the password is?

978
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:06,720
1 2 3 1 2 3

979
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:08,720
When I was little,

980
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:11,460
Choi Ga-young made me do drug delivery work.

981
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:15,860
She said that if a kid delivered the drugs, they would never get caught.

982
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:21,230
Locker number 11 at Hwajeong Station.

983
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,939
I thought this was a secret only you and I knew.

984
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:26,300
What could it be?

985
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,680
When we ran away holding hands,

986
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:34,250
I knew it right away.

987
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,180
Anyway,

988
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:41,150
here. Take this.

989
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:54,530
What's wrong?

990
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:07,680
I said, what's wrong?

991
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:19,960
My mom died.

992
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:22,430
What?

993
01:21:28,570 --> 01:21:30,500
My mom died.

994
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:36,440
Do-kyung, my mom died.

995
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,880
My mom died.

996
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:44,380
I was so scared.

997
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:48,020
I couldn't do anything.

998
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:51,160
I told you we should go together.

999
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:54,660
Right? Didn't I tell you that?

1000
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:00,200
Didn't I say we should go together?

1001
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:06,940
Damn it.

1002
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:14,180
I clearly said we should go together

1003
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:21,119
After all, it's just a damn woman who died

1004
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,690
Why are you so sad

1005
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,260
Take the gold and get lost

1006
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:42,239
Didn't you also wish she'd die sooner

1007
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:45,180
I told you to take the gold and get lost quickly

1008
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:33,690
So disappointing, so disappointing, Daojing

1009
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:40,870
Li Daojing

1010
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,870
Just live your life the way you are

1011
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:48,670
I'll live mine the way I want

1012
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:21,310
Things are in complete chaos now

1013
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:23,340
The boss said he wants to see you all

1014
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:25,580
Stop this, leave now

1015
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,720
Jia Ying would probably want that too

1016
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:25,140
We can't leave the Central China Market

1017
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:30,040
No, we mustn’t leave

1018
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,910
We need to completely deal with this group of bastards

1019
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:01,810
Damn woman

1020
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:02,909
Do you know where this place is? How dare you come here

1021
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:04,040
Damn woman

1022
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,010
Hey, come here

1023
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:08,550
Do you want to die

1024
01:26:08,650 --> 01:26:10,119
You all think I'm finished, don't you

1025
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,449
Damn it, you think I'm finished, right

1026
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:13,020
I will never die, damn woman

1027
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:14,890
Once I recover, I'll kill you all.

1028
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:15,920
Damn it, I'll tear you apart!

1029
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,460
You wretched woman, what is that in your hand?

1030
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:19,890
We're giving you an opportunity right now.

1031
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,030
Hey, hey, Daojing, don't do this!

1032
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:23,830
Daojing!

1033
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:25,130
Don't act like that!

1034
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:29,800
Stop shouting, be quiet!

1035
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:32,470
The details gathered while following the broker,

1036
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:33,610
share them with us.

1037
01:26:33,611 --> 01:26:35,040
You're truly insane! Damn it.

1038
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:36,440
If you do, I'll give you gold.

1039
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,410
Provide us with that information.

1040
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:41,750
The kind of sorry landlord you've become,

1041
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,750
we'll take revenge for you.

1042
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,120
Give me some water.

1043
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:14,710
The landlord recently launched a new website.

1044
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,350
There'll be a major tournament in a few days.

1045
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:20,219
Rumor has it the landlord bet his entire fortune,

1046
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:21,649
gambling that the game will lose by over 6 points.

1047
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:22,720
If they lose the next match…

1048
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,390
if caught secretly betting in their own territory,

1049
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:28,830
by rules, they'll be beaten half to death.

1050
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:29,630
-Yes. -Yes.

1051
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:30,699
-Thank you for your hard work. -Thank you for your hard work.

1052
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:33,570
He did the absolutely impossible.

1053
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:36,170
Looks like he's really scared now.

1054
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:38,900
We’re not the type to get bullied.

1055
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:41,640
As long as Choi Cheol’s team wins,

1056
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:43,910
That guy’s done for.

1057
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:46,749
-=Hardcore Bar=-

1058
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:48,580
-Why is this happening? -Seriously...

1059
01:27:48,581 --> 01:27:50,150
-=Jenny, Hyang Mi=-

1060
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:50,080
-So annoying. -Just get to the point.

1061
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:52,249
-What’s going on? -Come on...

1062
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:54,650
-Why did we have to come here? -So irritating.

1063
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,250
-Good grief. -What time are we supposed to do makeup?

1064
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,220
-What are you doing? -What’s happening?

1065
01:27:57,290 --> 01:27:58,360
Hurry it up!

1066
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:00,360
Seriously, I’m speechless.

1067
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:02,230
-Quiet, quiet. -So frustrating.

1068
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:04,330
-Kids, look over here. -What’s this about?

1069
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,230
Come on, dragging us from Gangnam to Bukchang-dong?

1070
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:07,300
What are we even doing here?

1071
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:10,770
-Hwajin, 80 million won. -Damn, what’s this about?

1072
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:11,840
Autumn, 52 million won
Are we exposing secrets now?

1073
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,070
-Eujin unni, 120 million won. -You’re really saying this here?

1074
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:16,980
And Daji has 90 million won.

1075
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,610
Seriously, unni, what are you doing?!

1076
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,640
Why are you exposing our secrets?

1077
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:21,810
That's really irritating.

1078
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:23,120
Are you worried that the people here have forgotten

1079
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:24,420
they're living with a leash around their necks?

1080
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:26,250
-What the hell? Damn it. -Why is this happening?

1081
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,150
Did you call everyone here

1082
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:28,650
-on their time off just to expose us? -Unbelievable.

1083
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,790
What exactly do you want?

1084
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:31,890
Hey, let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1085
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:33,429
This is driving me crazy. Why are they doing this?

1086
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:34,360
What in the world is going on?

1087
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:35,530
-Please sit down. -Seriously.

1088
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:37,800
Director Choi, who defrauded us of our villa...

1089
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:42,230
I heard his backer is the Land Boss.

1090
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:43,399
-What? -Is that true?

1091
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,400
-Director Choi? -Director Choi?

1092
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:45,300
-He's the Land Boss? -Seriously?

1093
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:46,610
-What? -Is that true?

1094
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:47,240
Hey!

1095
01:28:47,241 --> 01:28:48,410
-The Land Boss? -Is that really the case?

1096
01:28:48,510 --> 01:28:49,570
Let's kill him.

1097
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:53,550
He's the one who has kept us constrained like this all along.

1098
01:28:54,710 --> 01:29:00,520
And that guy also killed our mother.

1099
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:01,090
What?

1100
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,520
-What? -Really?
He killed Mom?

1101
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:04,120
This is going too far.

1102
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:05,360
Is this true?

1103
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:06,760
- Really? - Truly insane.

1104
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:09,930
I'll make him pay for it.

1105
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:15,700
Please, everyone, do me a favor.

1106
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:25,980
What's wrong?

1107
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:27,210
Boss
As per your instructions,

1108
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:29,980
we've invested all the funds on the losing side.

1109
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,600
Pass the information to powerful and ambitious guests.

1110
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:46,030
Get them to invest.

1111
01:29:47,170 --> 01:29:48,970
Tell them the outcome will be manipulated.

1112
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,100
So if they bet, they'll definitely win.

1113
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:57,140
-=Victory by a margin of 6 points=-

1114
01:29:57,610 --> 01:29:59,280
Let's show what we're capable of.

1115
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:02,180
Go all out.

1116
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:13,990
-=Spending gold really is addictive. Life’s but once. Watch closely, I'll burn everything with gold.=-

1117
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:27,340
-=Splurging again today! Spending gold really is addictive
Life’s but once. Watch closely, I'll burn everything with gold.=-

1118
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:44,960
Feels unfair, doesn't it?

1119
01:30:48,130 --> 01:30:50,460
Being able to shoot but not allowed to.

1120
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,970
I've already retired.

1121
01:30:57,770 --> 01:30:59,200
But you,

1122
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:02,510
how long will you endure under Choi Cheol?

1123
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:12,180
Recently faced three consecutive losses, WP hosts CM at home.

1124
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:13,619
Aiming to end their losing streak.

1125
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:15,290
Three straight losses are a concern,

1126
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:17,519
but WP's recent performance has been deeply disappointing.

1127
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,220
This will be a critical match for the ace player stuck in a slump

1128
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:22,490
Li Hanxu must showcase his skills

1129
01:31:22,530 --> 01:31:23,530
Not just Coach Choi

1130
01:31:23,531 --> 01:31:27,270
Everyone’s determination to win is needed as the showdown begins

1131
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:28,569
Compared to the start of the match

1132
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:29,669
The second half is even more crucial

1133
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:30,740
And at such pivotal moments

1134
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,209
What kind of performance emerges matters greatly

1135
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:35,540
Li Hanxu, who is currently in a slump

1136
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:36,709
Previously participated in a match where his entry led to

1137
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:38,640
-A successful comeback -Yes

1138
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:41,910
Curious how today’s match will unfold

1139
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:40,150
WP CM 1 Park Inseop 10 0 Kim Minguk 9 2 Song Jeongwoo 12 5 Wei Jungwoo 19 3 Yoon Yongjun
9 7 Choi Junhoan 7 9 Hong Dongmyung 13 10 Han Younggi 20 11 Choi Jeonghwan 17 12 Kim Chanrong 8

1140
01:31:40,151 --> 01:31:41,886
WP CM 1 Park Inseop 10 0 Kim Minguk 9 2 Song Jeongwoo 12 5 Wei Jungwoo 19 3 Yoon Yongjun
9 7 Choi Junhoan 7 9 Li Hanxu 13 10 Han Younggi 20 11 Choi Jeonghwan 17 12 Kim Chanrong 8

1141
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:43,280
At this critical moment in the fourth quarter

1142
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,150
Player Li Hanxu is sent to the court

1143
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:46,180
That’s him
That’s Li Hanxu

1144
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:47,949
What kind of performance will he deliver

1145
01:31:47,950 --> 01:31:48,950
Highly anticipated
Li Hanxu is on the court

1146
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:52,560
He immediately gets caught in unnecessary psychological games

1147
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:53,390
Needs to be more careful

1148
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:56,229
Gives away a technical foul due to unnecessary actions

1149
01:31:56,230 --> 01:31:57,960
Leading to a free throw opportunity

1150
01:31:58,030 --> 01:31:59,730
However, Li Hanxu’s recent

1151
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:01,470
Free throw accuracy has been low

1152
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:03,920
I mentioned it back then, didn't I?

1153
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:07,620
You must take responsibility for your own life.

1154
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:10,470
If you get used to losing,

1155
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:13,650
when you really want to win, you won't be able to.

1156
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:15,570
If this free throw goes in, it will tie the score.

1157
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:17,999
Scoring—tie game.

1158
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,370
The WP team, suppressed throughout the game,

1159
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,670
has finally leveled the score.

1160
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,749
He must be under immense pressure, yet he's showcasing extraordinary skill.

1161
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:29,219
Well done. After scoring the free throw, Lee Han Seo's performance has completely transformed.

1162
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:32,099
Lee Han Seo is rushing toward the basket—hurry!

1163
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,619
Stay calm, stay calm.

1164
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,899
Now comes the turnaround.

1165
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:36,970
After narrowly saving the ball,

1166
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,099
they've successfully completed yet another hand-off play leading to a three-pointer.

1167
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:41,819
The three-point shot is in!

1168
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:45,299
The entire game dynamic has completely changed—the tide has turned.

1169
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:47,949
Lee Han Seo, who had been underperforming all this time,

1170
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:51,269
is showing an outstanding performance today, making everyone forget his slump.

1171
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:53,069
Lee Han Seo's energy hasn't faltered.

1172
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:55,369
With every shot, he pierces through the defense.

1173
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:58,369
Today, Lee Han Seo has perfectly—perfectly regained

1174
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:00,469
the form of the player we all know and admire.

1175
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:03,269
At the crucial moment, Lee Han Seo stepped up,

1176
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:05,369
leading the team to victory.

1177
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:07,450
He truly is a star player.

1178
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:09,399
89 to 78.

1179
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:12,199
The WP team, perfectly revived by Lee Han-wook,

1180
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,600
won the game today.

1181
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:15,919
The ace is back.

1182
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,520
Super ace Lee Han-wook has returned.

1183
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:21,250
- Lee Han-wook. - Lee Han-wook.

1184
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,169
Representative, the kids haven't been active,

1185
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:42,070
so we have no sales.

1186
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:56,900
Open your mouth.

1187
01:33:58,050 --> 01:33:59,050
Representative.

1188
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:02,770
Open your mouth.

1189
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:15,900
I dragged in the kids working at other places, Boss.

1190
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:24,600
Open up.

1191
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:47,930
- Unnie Sang-ok -

1192
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:51,970
Yes, Unnie.

1193
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,219
It's been quite fun so far.

1194
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,820
We should know when to stop now. Don't go too far.

1195
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:01,470
I'll send you the coordinates of where your mom died.

1196
01:35:01,870 --> 01:35:04,120
Before your friends' faces are ruined,

1197
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:06,050
clean this up immediately.

1198
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:09,350
See you later.

1199
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:42,820
I brought your gold.

1200
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:48,220
Let the girls go.

1201
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,570
Hey, chop off her wrist that's holding the gold!

1202
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,520
Let them go.

1203
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:22,970
Daojing, run!

1204
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,200
Run, Daojing!

1205
01:37:25,450 --> 01:37:26,450
Are you okay?

1206
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:28,900
Yeah, I'm fine. We're fine.

1207
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:30,670
Take care of yourself. Live well.

1208
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,700
You nasty woman!

1209
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:52,700
Hey!

1210
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,900
Open the door! Open the door!

1211
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,320
For goodness' sake.

1212
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:06,720
Hurry and start the car!

1213
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:58,450
Mishan, Liu Mishan!

1214
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:15,870
Damn it, you filthy woman!

1215
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:45,370
Die!

1216
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:18,500
I'll send you back to your mother!

1217
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:23,520
You bastard!

1218
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:27,870
Damn it—no!

1219
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:36,470
Die, scumbag!

1220
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:37,870
Hey, Li Daojing!

1221
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:53,220
Come inside!

1222
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:57,650
We need to settle this once and for all!

1223
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:01,520
Do you think you can escape the Huazhong market?

1224
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:12,900
Can we just let this go?

1225
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:16,170
No.

1226
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,050
No, we can't.

You're really quite troublesome.

1231

These heartless girls.

1232
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:00,850
Actually giving gifts like this.

1233
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:05,130
Let's go, time to find my money.

1234
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:09,020
How long has it been since I walked around like this at this hour?

1235
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:12,920
You feel regret, don't you?

1236
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:16,769
You're wearing a face full of regret.

1237
01:43:16,770 --> 01:43:18,020
What's gotten into you?

1238
01:43:19,870 --> 01:43:20,870
Hey.

1239
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:22,950
Do you really not have a single penny?

1240
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:25,620
No.

1241
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:28,900
Stop lying, do you seriously not have any money?

1242
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:32,420
I said no.

1243
01:43:33,650 --> 01:43:37,950
This guy spends every day stealing, and even then can't swipe this.

1244
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:42,220
Dammit, how could there be money in this situation?

1245
01:43:44,850 --> 01:43:46,099
If you had money, what would you do?

1246
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:47,769
I want to go backpacking, idiot.

1247
01:43:47,770 --> 01:43:49,000
Backpacking, really?

1248
01:43:49,370 --> 01:43:51,750
Where would you get a backpack, you broke fool?

1249
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:53,020
Quite the dreamer.

1250
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Hey.

1251
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:00,150
What are we going to do from now on?

1252
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:02,250
What can we do?

1253
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:03,500
Just survive.

1254
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,520
By the way, if you were backpacking, where would you want to go?

1255
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:08,900
Aren’t you broke? Why even ask?

1256
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:13,950
Feels like you do have money, though.
