00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.180
Hey. Let's go ride in with you, bro. Hi, Ford.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:18.990
I gotta get back, bro. Little brother, tell me one thing before you go. How did I die?

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.430
You got shot. We could have escaped, but I made us go back for Spidey.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.590
Then we had to go back. That's not your fault.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.070
How did I die? We weren't even supposed to be out there.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.170
I got us caught. Because I disobeyed orders.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.510
That's just you, little girl.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.270
All of you, brother. Scowl.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.980
I killed my brother. No matter what happens, I have to live with that for the rest of my life.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.240
I wish I could do it.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.040
I wish I could do it.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.040
If I have another stupid seizure underwater.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.980
Yeah. You'd be me without a mask.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.620
Oh, my God.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.220
Uh, let's test that. Let's see what happens.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.120
What's the stitches? What's the stitches?

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.540
You like that, huh?

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.900
No!

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:21.700
No! No! No! No! No! No!

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:50.340
The fire of hate is only the ash of grief. My mother mourned the ancient way, singing her son's life during the daily eclipse. Because the light always returns.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.230
There's the Navi way, and then there's my dad's way. Say nothing, keep busy.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.910
The reef people say the sea washes you clean. Washes away your sins.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.950
What do you got? You're supposed to be collecting guns that think you're useless.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:20.610
Focus. Focus, boy. Don't let your mother see that.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.880
Excuse me. Duke!

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.120
Sick.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:07:08.230
What is this? It's an AR. Right? This is the MAC. It's where the bullets are. Empty. Slap it. Brack it. And then boom, you can just spray. You can kill a lot of sky people with this.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.750
See? Ceramic action. Clean them and oil them. Seems good as new.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.250
This is not the Navi way, Jake's wound.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:23.950
Weapons of metal are forbidden. You know this. To touch them poisons the heart. Ewa will provide.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.740
The mourning period is not even over. Duke.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.220
You should be with your family, not gathering these things. Your woman needs you.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:47.900
My son lies with the ancestors in the reef. This is our home. I said I would stand and fight, but I can't fight gunships with spears.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:57.160
We sank the demon ship. The pinkskins fear us now. Yeah? We got lucky. And they got many more ships.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:12.460
At least we got these. We are grateful you stand with us, Jake's wound. It is not guns we need. It is rider of last shadow. Ride, great Toruk, as you did before.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:27.320
When you ride the beast, you become the beast. And the more blood, the better. I will not become Toruk Macto again.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:36.160
Jake's wound. You are always Toruk Macto. Come, Toruk Macto.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.810
Can you hear me? Yeah, with me. Allowed as they go on, Doctor.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:53.710
So, uh, we've been through the wreck. Inside and out. We've searched through about a 200 meter radius around it.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:59.310
We didn't find any of anybody. Just crew. All right. What's left with him?

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.770
Well, keep looking. We ought to expand the search radius. Roger that.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.010
If no, though, I did find an instinct. New algae.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.500
Sully's still out there.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.540
We don't know that. Scavenger's gonna carry it off the bodies.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:22.420
Nope. He made it out. And he's in this area. Down to a handful of villages. You just give me a ship and I'll...

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.120
I gave you a ship. It's right there. On the bottom.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:35.860
Yeah. Along with my crew. All dead. You brought me out here. 26 trillion miles for a single mission.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:42.160
A kinetic hard kill up against one guy. I ain't backing off.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.500
You brought me out here.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.530
You brought me out here.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:04.010
The spirit of my ancestors is in this ball. It was our strength.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.350
I can help you fix it, Laura.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:24.800
No! It's ruined! Everything I touch gets ruined. They never talked about it.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.700
But it was there in the room. Like a crouching tenedor.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:46.070
I know you will never give up your bow. Just don't be close when it hits.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.900
So you agreed with Renaud?

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.080
I will never speak against my husband in front of that woman.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:26.200
Look, I'm a Marine. Not taking a knife to a gunfight. Or a prayer.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:34.020
So what am I supposed to do? I can't run. I can't fight.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:38.220
Well, that's right. Awa will provide. Yeah?

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.320
So where was Awa? Where was Awa when our son...

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:41.540
Jake!

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.960
I'm in this place where I have nothing.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.660
Not my people. Not my forest.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.040
Even my father's bow is gone.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.020
All I have...

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.400
All I have...

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.600
is my faith.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.560
And this is the great mother's plan.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.120
You have this family.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.140
And you have me.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.320
And I love you so much.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.960
It sucks that Pycon is still an outcast.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.680
Yeah, after saving all our asses...

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.940
No. I'm sorry, but by the Tokun Wei, he bears the deaths.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.720
All those who died in the battle.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.480
He bears those deaths.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.440
I'm sorry. You saved us all.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.560
I'm sorry.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:23.900
I'm sorry, everybody.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:25.580
I'm sorry.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.910
Dad!

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.670
Wait, where's the spare?

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:46.510
It's in the basket, I think.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:46.830
Dad!

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:47.750
Wake up!

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:48.330
Hey!

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.510
Where's the spare mask?

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:50.770
Where's the spare mask?

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:51.790
It used to be there. Where is it?

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.890
Find it!

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:53.910
It's not here!

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:55.110
Speak to me! Where is it?

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:55.910
I can't find it!

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.130
Where is it?

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.150
Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.450
I got it! Dad! Dad!

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:00.410
I found it!

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:08.870
Breathe!

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.710
Breathe!

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:10.510
Breathe!

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.470
Deep and slow.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.230
Deep and slow.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.290
There you go. You're okay.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:16.890
I'm good.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:18.190
I'm good.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:19.370
I'm good.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:32.870
I'm okay.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.430
The wind traders! The wind traders are here!

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.650
The wind traders are coming! Come on!

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:47.430
Come on, let's go!

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:48.750
Come on!

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:40.800
Look at him!

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.400
He's not gonna take up much room!

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.840
As long as he's no trouble!

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.800
Take a knee! Let's go!

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:47.540
Sook!

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.280
Come on!

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:48.580
Keri!

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:49.940
Keri! Keri, please!

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.620
Children, please sit down, please!

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.520
Your mother and I have come to a decision.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.960
Spider, you're gonna live back in high camp with no one.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:04.280
What?

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.700
The wind traders will take you.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.120
No!

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:06.640
Dad!

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.380
You can't!

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.400
Spider!

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.300
You can't live in a mask day and night.

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.120
I just want to stay here with you.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.460
I know, but she's too risky.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.320
This isn't fair.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.340
But please, you're the only family I've ever known.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.820
This is what's best for you.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.580
But dad, he's our best friend!

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:23.960
Can we just find a way?

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.060
He's too dangerous.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.480
You're one dead battery away from being dead yourself.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.520
He belongs with his own kind.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:30.440
Mom?

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.200
And what kind is that, mother?

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:34.460
Alien?

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:34.860
Kitty.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:35.960
Pink ass.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:36.760
Stop.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.280
You hate them so much, that's all you see?

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.340
It's Spider!

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.180
Please, Jake.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.160
Mr. Sully, I won't be any problem.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:45.780
You know that.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.040
Dad, this isn't right.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.040
Spider is part of this family.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.320
He will never be a part of this family.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.820
The caravan is the safest way to move him.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.700
No, please.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.360
He's gone today.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:17:59.980
You can't do this.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.800
It's a dog deal.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:01.680
Enough!

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.960
This is a family.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.140
It's not a democracy.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.260
All right?

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.080
I hate you!

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.460
This is what is best, baby girl.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:08.740
No!

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.500
Don't touch me!

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.380
Hey, it's okay.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:14.940
You understand?

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:15.420
No.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.120
I already lost my brother.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.400
I can't lose anyone else.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.540
Sully, stick together.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:30.880
Yup.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.500
That's the family motto.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.400
That's bullshit.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.320
This isn't fair.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.040
Okay.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.180
Hey.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:40.940
All right?

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:41.780
How about this?

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.600
We all go together to drop him off.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.520
Katie?

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.980
You said you wanted to see your grandmother.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.020
Yeah.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.200
It will be an adventure.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.520
For the whole family.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:56.840
Yeah.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.340
Cool.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.080
Hey.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:11.740
Stay here.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.740
Our arrangement was for the pigskin boy only.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.100
There won't be any trouble.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:19.800
There won't be any trouble.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.820
You are already trouble.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.440
The traitor must move.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.520
Clearly we cannot choose sides.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.580
Having Toruk Makto on board constantly close to choosing a side in this war.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:29.680
You know what?

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.440
To me, you're mistaken.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.120
Toruk Makto was never on your ship.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.580
But if he was ever aboard, then...

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.440
I mean, this woman would be happy to fly as outriders and protect your caravan.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.340
Perhaps so.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.800
The manguan raiders grow more aggressive now.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:54.660
Very well.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.380
I meet you on this.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.500
nice.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.310
That must move!

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:37.890
Windward!!

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:38.110
dura!

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:39.110
Vオルtal!

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:39.670
Fall内!

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:40.430
And race!

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.650
Fall to inwards!

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:42.190
Game!

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.830
Game!

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.500
Woo!

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.080
Yeah!

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.390
Everyone penguins on their own way.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.160
For me, it's being up here alone.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:17.800
I feel him with me. Bro, check it out. I hear his voice in the wind.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:48.440
Hold this. Hey, Dad, I've been thinking. I should carry a rifle, and I can fly with you.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.600
That's gonna happen. Why not? You trained me to shoot.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.040
Okay, I know what I'm doing.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.780
Where's your comms? I called you like five times.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.980
Where are your comms? It's rule number one.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:23.660
You can't even do that. That's it.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.880
What you got? So I promised this guy an imaging a case of beer if you ever got something for us.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.660
Long range patrols clap these guys when they punch our airspace.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.940
It's a routine flyby. Here's the enhanced.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.620
Smile, bitches.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.080
Weigh in. 1350 today. We got coordinates.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.320
Let's man out.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.380
Thank you.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.900
I'm good. I got plenty of time.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.520
I'm good. I got plenty of time.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.400
Shit, my comms.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.430
Hey, Terry. Hey, Terry. Do you a copy?

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:09.330
Bro, come on! Jump!

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.050
No! No!

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:11.970
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.220
Paul!

00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.520
You okay?

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:00.480
Duke!

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:01.620
Duke!

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.000
You okay?

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.220
Duke! Duke! Duke!

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.200
You okay?

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.060
Bro, you good?

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:06.640
Yeah.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.460
Sweet girl! Sweet girl!

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.300
I'm so sorry!

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.580
I'm so sorry!

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:13.720
It's okay.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:14.620
It's okay.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:28.400
Bro, my spear's on the ship.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.260
What?

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.080
My backup's on that ship.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:31.840
Shit!

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.400
Giddy, stay here.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.750
Whoa!

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:24.940
You gotta go! You gotta go!

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:25.220
Shit!

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.560
Come on, we gotta go!

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:29.780
Gary, come on!

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.540
Gary, come on!

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.040
Come on!

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:32.260
Go!

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:32.500
Go!

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.340
We're coming, get to the flight!

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:38.220
Ruby!

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.240
Keep going!

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.180
Jerry, come on!

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:42.780
Greet them!

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:43.840
Come on, Duke!

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.140
Hurry!

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:46.680
Hurry!

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:47.280
собой!

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.130
Get going! Get going!

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:20.830
Look at that belt. What goes through?

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.150
Saeed, look.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:39.230
On me!

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:54.530
Come on!

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.000
No, no!

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:17.460
Keep going!

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:24.810
We gotta get the water, come on.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.950
Come on, come on, come on.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.760
Come on, come on.

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.260
What is that? What is that?

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.160
So they stick together.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.720
No, the other one.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.640
So they never quit.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:45.600
That's right.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.240
So they never quit.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:56.320
Come on, come on!

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.360
Eagli, do you copy?

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.260
Loak, come in boy, answer me.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.920
I got you.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:02.580
I got you.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:12.760
I got you.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.800
Do you see them?

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:24.620
No.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.440
Let's get out of sight.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.020
I wanna go home.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:28.840
Dude, come on.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.080
I'm tired and I'm hungry.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.800
I wanna go home.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.100
Dad has no idea where we are.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.300
We got no comms.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:38.960
We're on our own.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.280
Bro, I've got to get a mask.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.720
What are we gonna do?

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:44.360
I don't know.

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.620
Why am I in charge?

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:46.820
Calm down.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.720
We have to do something.

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:49.660
Shut up.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:51.800
Loak.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.000
Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.120
We have to go back to the ship.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.440
No, we can't go back to the ship.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.740
Those guys are between us and the ship.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.600
No, that's our last known position.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.820
That's where Dad's gonna be looking for us.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:02.240
Bro, no.

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.200
Come on, we'll just circle around them.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.120
It's a good idea.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:04.880
Which way?

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.200
This way.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.680
Come on, everyone follow me.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:17.800
It's all over, Jake.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.330
You stay real still.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:30.550
Is that all you got?

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:33.050
That'll do.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:34.370
Still smart at us, huh?

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:35.830
See those hands.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.910
Hands!

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:39.690
I...

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.030
I killed you.

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.360
I guess I don't die that easy, Corporal.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:51.590
No!

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:55.650
Help...

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:56.610
Help me.

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.100
Who hit you, Corporal?

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.040
Mount Quadraters.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.760
They call themselves ash people.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
What's this?

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.580
They cut the crew.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.500
They take their enemies toward their power.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.800
That's worse than death to these guys.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:26.960
Any sign of them?

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.360
Kids are gone.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.080
That's fully charged.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.080
Which means he missed his mask change.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.080
And he's running out.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.360
And that's if these ash people don't get to him first.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.800
We gotta go after these kids right now.

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.420
But you're never gonna see him again.

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:44.920
Can you track him?

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.000
That is not the mission. What are we doing?

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:47.980
Can you track him?

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:49.960
We're burning time, Colonel.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:50.940
Boss.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.440
We got him right of here.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.060
Oh, the cuffs stand.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.600
Which way?

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.720
Oh, you're gonna get me killed.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.020
Again.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.540
Come on.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:07.980
This way.

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:13.210
The river's got to be just up ahead. Come on.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.360
It's not good.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.120
What can we do?

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.240
My people, conserve your air.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:29.480
Look at me.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:31.580
Take slow breaths.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.020
Look, can you carry him?

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:34.400
Yeah, yeah.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.360
Come on, bro.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.120
Appreciate you.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:58.470
The kids went in the water.

00:39:58.850 --> 00:39:59.550
Smart move.

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:12.110
No, no, no.

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.090
Spider, please.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:16.610
Great mother.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.170
Save the sky first.

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:20.070
I beg you.

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:21.870
There's no time to pray.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:22.370
He's dying.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.850
It's okay.

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:26.790
It's gonna be okay, buddy.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:28.090
Just breathe.

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:30.290
Kitty.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:32.450
Kitty, we need to go.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:32.830
Come on.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:47.910
We can't sit around here.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:48.450
We have to go.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.890
Kitty.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:52.030
Kitty, come on.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:58.680
Stop.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.580
Bring him.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:02.480
Here.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.180
Kitty, stop.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:04.860
Quickly.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:05.440
Stop.

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:07.520
Do as I say.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.240
Put him here.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:28.610
Stop.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:29.690
Kitty, what are you doing?

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:30.870
What are you doing?

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:35.330
What are you doing?

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:37.050
I'm not sure.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:38.990
This feels right.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:39.730
What?

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:42.070
Be quiet.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.950
I can't talk.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:56.780
Blow up.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:57.720
Blow up.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.380
This mask.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.080
Take it off.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.020
What?

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:31.380
What?

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.020
He can't breathe.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:36.570
Come on.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:23.110
Kitty.

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:23.590
Kitty.

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:25.050
Kitty.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:25.410
Kitty.

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:26.270
No.

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.950
No.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:28.850
No.

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:29.070
No.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:33.550
No.

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.040
I'm breathing.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:46.160
Yes.

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:46.940
But keep on.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.540
You are.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:49.240
You are.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:52.660
I'm dead.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.240
This is the spirit world.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:57.880
No, guys.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:58.820
You're still here.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.820
I'm breathing the air.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.140
Yeah.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.500
I'm breathing the air!

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.860
I'm breathing the air!

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:10.880
I'm breathing the air!

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.180
I guess we don't need this to post it anymore.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.240
Yeah!

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.700
Breathe in the air, baby!

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:18.800
Yeah!

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:19.880
No, no, quiet!

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:20.580
Quiet!

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:28.190
Whatever you did.

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:29.290
Thank you.

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:32.110
Shit!

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:33.090
Get back!

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:37.170
Stay behind me, stay behind me!

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:38.350
Come

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:42.530
I'm

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:44.150
You're

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.310
You're

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:45.990
SEE

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.210
LILLIUS!

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:57.170
OHạo,ätng!週

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:29.860
no How

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.220
is he breathing with no mask?

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:36.480
I can't even think about that right now. We gotta get in there.

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:44.100
Is not our air poison to sky people?

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.940
Do you still live every thou?

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.260
Because it is the will of Ewa.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.200
No!

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.010
Ewa?

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:08.930
Yes.

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:17.290
If I cut now, do you think Ewa will come to save him?

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:21.490
Come on, get these off me. Come on, they're gonna kill him.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:22.570
Do you think?

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:26.700
No.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:33.080
Your goddess has no dominion here.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.480
Come on. Here we go. Now give me another knife.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:41.900
Carl.

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:51.170
You.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.420
Show me how this works.

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:09.370
I can't. It's empty. No thunder.

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:10.470
Make thunder.

00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:12.970
I can't. It's empty.

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:14.670
Make it to work.

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:19.100
There's no thunder.

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.380
Kill the youngest one.

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.180
No, no, no, no, no, no! Please, please, no!

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:25.560
No!

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.100
Weapons down!

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.460
Down!

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:49.130
Back!

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:51.010
Go on!

00:48:55.090 --> 00:49:11.220
Stay back, you're back, you're back. All right, kids, on me. All right, get the wheeze on out of here. On me, on me, on me.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.040
You...

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:24.430
And that's the match.

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:30.940
See?

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:37.030
And now you take aim, what do you want to hit?

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.730
Or just go like this.

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:45.330
Yeah.

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.930
Go on.

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:15.290
I do not need you now, Skyman.

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:17.770
Find him, Will.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:18.550
On my knees.

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:20.350
Reveal for sacrifice!

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:32.640
Maintini!

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:34.960
Cut her down.

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:35.700
Cut her down.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:39.660
Maintini, we got you.

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:40.460
You're gonna be okay.

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:41.260
You okay?

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:42.380
We got you.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.120
Max, we're up for surgery.

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:45.800
Go! Open both doors!

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:48.360
Get rid of me, you okay?

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:52.540
FILE, FILE!

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:52.900
FILE, FILE!

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:53.620
FILE!

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:55.380
FILE!

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:55.440
FILE!

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:57.460
FILE!

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.060
FILE!

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:06.880
I don't know how many folks know their notes.

00:53:23.160 --> 00:54:03.410
Hey, where's the girl?

00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:06.700
Come on, play!

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:07.480
Let's go.

00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:25.290
Sayig.

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:33.450
We searched by air.

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.840
We're like air with my air.

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:44.140
Tops him.

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.200
Easy, easy, Matt.

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:48.740
No!

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:49.200
No!

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:51.340
No!

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:53.700
My children!

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:54.820
My children!

00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:55.560
My children!

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:55.900
Daughter!

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:56.760
Tom!

00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:57.940
My children!

00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:59.220
My children!

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:00.400
Wait.

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:03.160
Wait.

00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:21.970
Come on, let's hustle!

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:22.990
Max, get me in!

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:23.390
Yeah, yeah.

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:23.910
Are we hot?

00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:24.930
We're hot.

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:26.490
Alright, don't even calibrate.

00:55:28.690 --> 00:55:31.910
You must arrest my child, don't you?

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.510
Goodbye.

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:33.150
Thank you.

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:36.650
I will ride.

00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:37.410
Come.

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:38.950
Oh, my God!

00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:41.550
I'm okay.

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:51.360
I got you.

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:00.890
This is good.

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:13.140
We're clear.

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:14.160
Yeah.

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:19.880
Which brings us to our unresolved dishes.

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.400
How about that, Rose?

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:31.290
Still got our knives.

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.260
They're all kinda tired.

00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:41.940
Yeah.

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.160
Yeah.

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:45.380
Better save it.

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:50.720
In case those flying monkeys show off.

00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.040
Yeah, sure.

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.900
You and the missus must have done something right, I'll give you that.

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:11.260
He's a good kid.

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.160
Yeah, he's a great kid.

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:20.820
Hey, uh, this don't mean we're gonna start taking long walks together.

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:23.200
I'm still bringing you in.

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:25.140
Dad, if I have to.

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:30.280
Hold this time out here and you still don't get it.

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.060
This world goes much deeper than you imagine.

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.240
You witnessed it tonight.

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.520
With her.

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.120
With him.

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.640
Don't matter.

00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:52.780
It don't matter what color I am.

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.960
I still remember what team I'm playing for.

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:00.960
You got new eyes, Colonel.

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.760
All you gotta do is open.

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:27.590
It's the ash.

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:28.470
Get up!

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:29.230
Come on, we gotta move!

00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:29.630
Get up!

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:31.310
Come on, we gotta move!

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:32.190
Come on, we gotta move!

00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:34.370
Get up!

00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:35.190
Get up!

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.330
Get up!

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:36.110
Get up!

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.530
It's okay.

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.950
It's okay.

00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:37.430
They're ours!

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:38.250
They're ours!

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.870
Hey!

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:40.010
Hey!

00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:40.510
Hey!

00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:44.970
Jake!

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:46.990
I got Sam!

00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:48.190
Katie, Duke!

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:49.210
Are you hurt?

00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:50.870
Did you find it?

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.650
Mama!

00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.610
I'm Duke!

00:58:58.090 --> 00:58:58.490
Duke!

00:58:59.010 --> 00:58:59.450
Katie!

00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:00.290
Look!

00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:03.510
Jake!

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:06.090
Are you okay?

00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:07.890
Come here, it's okay.

00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:08.630
Are you okay?

00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:13.190
Hey, Norf...

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:27.030
What's up? What? Dude! Oh, yeah. I'm good on the whole air thing.

00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:39.250
Get it. Get it.

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:49.080
Iron Scarf, the one actual. We are inbound at the city wall.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:04.280
So you think he's still with Sully? I'd make book on it.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:10.680
This is not my priority. My priority is getting this city built and sending back Amrita to pay for it.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.380
And who do you think sets your priorities to?

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.180
It's the big picture, guys. So here's a big picture concept for you.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.120
How are we supposed to colonize this world if we can't breathe the frickin' air?

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.660
You wanna find the boy, you gotta find Sully.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.220
And there. How? How many more of these, huh?

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:28.100
Not many more. You said yesterday.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:33.080
Okay, here's the most recent scan. Now, you see this? This is all mycelium.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.700
It's basically the same thing as the forest network.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:42.000
Somehow it colonized him, spread through his entire system, and then made changes at the cellular level.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:46.780
I mean, look. It altered his blood chemistry, his nervous system, his lungs...

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:47.600
Can you get it out?

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.360
No, it's an endosymbiont.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.580
We think they're keeping each other alive. It could kill him if we even try.

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:58.920
But look. I mean, he's... he's alive, he's healthy...

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:00.880
Maybe this is a good thing.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.000
A good thing?

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.880
What if the RDA labs could reverse-engineer this?

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:12.300
What if every human being on Earth could live here without a mask?

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.620
Ah, Jake. There's something else. Sit. Hey, bud.

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:21.800
Okay.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.020
Hey!

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.660
Hold still. Hold still. You're fine.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:26.400
Ow.

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:27.460
Look at that.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.480
What is that?

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.000
He's growing a kudu.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.320
Wait, what?

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.100
Oh, yeah.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:57.420
Great mother. Are you there? Please, hear my small voice.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:06.040
I prayed to you in the forest to save my friend. I prayed so hard.

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:15.440
But you didn't come. You didn't answer. So, I had to do it myself.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:36.480
I don't know how I... I asked the woman... Please, just talk to me!

01:02:39.780 --> 01:03:03.590
No, no, please, please! No! No! No! No! No!

01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:09.430
A1 never came to me. I told you. I don't know how I did it.

01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:10.590
Drink.

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.830
Kitty.

01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:16.850
My child, you are touched by the old mother's hand.

01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:20.770
This we have known since you were born.

01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:31.450
There's something you're hiding.

01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:36.770
I have felt it my whole life. Just tell me the truth!

01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:38.490
Please!

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:41.310
Tell her.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:45.430
It is time.

01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:48.990
My child.

01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:54.710
You do not... have a father.

01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:55.510
Kitty.

01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.730
What?

01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:58.590
You...

01:03:58.590 --> 01:03:59.630
Your... your mother.

01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:01.130
Okay, Grace's avatar.

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:04.870
And when she was pregnant, Norm ran some tests.

01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:08.030
There was a... a... a parthenogenic birth.

01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:11.110
Uh, you're genetically identical to the Avatar.

01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:13.770
There literally is no father.

01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:16.690
I'm a clone.

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:18.510
Granddaughter.

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:21.910
It was the will of Ewa.

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:33.610
When the dreamwalker body lay here, in the great mother's hands, a seed was planted.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.180
I'm a clone.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.520
I'm a clone.

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.500
I'm a clone.

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:47.520
I'm a clone.

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.580
That really sucks.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:52.280
That makes me even more of a freak.

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:53.920
Oh, granddaughter.

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.940
You... are Ewa's child.

01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:06.210
I don't care how it happened.

01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:09.210
You're my baby girl.

01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:12.630
And I'm the only father you'll ever need.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.280
If I am so special...

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:24.220
Why does Ewa fold her ears to me?

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:30.540
Look, we don't know why, but you're locked out from her.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.080
It's some kind of firewall.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.140
It's like an encryption.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.140
The harder you try to break in, the harder it fights back.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.840
Ewa has a path for you.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.600
Though she chooses to conceal it, you must trust in her.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.060
I have to find out what it is.

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.040
No, you have to stop asking.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.760
Kitty, if...

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:55.560
If you try to connect again, you could die.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.680
You do it underwater, and you will die.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.200
He can't stay here.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.280
If the RDA get him...

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:09.560
We'll never stop her.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.300
If he is so dangerous...

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.840
To the people, to everything...

01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:17.440
We should just kill him.

01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:23.550
It's Spider.

01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:27.310
He'll come with us, he'll come to the reef.

01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:27.850
If...

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:29.450
We can protect him there.

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:37.530
Oh, baby, it's not like that.

01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:39.530
I just decided.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.180
Goody, baby! Get me up in there!

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:02.000
Get me in the pocket!

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.800
Get me in the pocket with the rocket!

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:06.680
He made it!

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:07.700
I knew...

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:08.800
Demonship...

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.720
Has come...

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:10.280
Bigger.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.880
What about Tulkuna being killed?

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.460
I'm so sorry, brother.

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:16.460
Sexually...

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:17.720
The outcast...

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.060
Is stirring up the young wolves.

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:22.340
Of Tulkuna have called to council to decide about him.

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:25.560
You must rest.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.440
This must be removed.

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.700
To see me.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:30.600
Kids.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:31.840
Kids on me.

01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:43.820
No, I'm serious.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:46.280
When it grows long enough, I'm gonna get my own E-Rue.

01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:47.260
Scallions.

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.260
You need a very small E-Rue.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.300
Just you watch, I'm gonna get my own skin.

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:53.180
Then I'll be there.

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.280
So how is this?

01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.240
Your daughter.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.340
Your half-blood daughter.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.140
With no training.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:03.960
Pull him.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.340
Has done what no Sahik could do.

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.120
Who are you to question the will of Ewa?

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.440
I am Sahik.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.740
Then be Sahik.

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:15.640
These herbs do nothing.

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.760
Herbs from my forest heal faster.

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.400
I tell you to rest.

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.060
You do not rest.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.240
Then you blame my herbs.

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.700
Hold still.

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:31.560
Stupid woman.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.240
Careful, Sahik.

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.940
Or I may forget that you are with child.

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.140
The matriarch has spoken.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.380
She says,

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:02.760
The outcast continues to defy the Tu Kunwei.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.960
All killing is forbidden.

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.020
He was outcast for this.

01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:09.160
But he has done it again.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.940
The outcast attacked the demon ship.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.140
Bringing death to our people.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.620
Even the son of Toruk Mato.

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.380
Dad, I can't believe I got sick.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:21.980
No, no.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.200
She says,

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:30.860
He continues to disrupt.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.400
Spreading bad ideas among our young.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.460
It's bullshit, it's not true.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.140
She says,

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.840
He will only bring more death.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.840
Dad, why don't you say something?

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.000
Please.

01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:52.640
She says,

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.320
The outcast may not stay in these waters.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.840
He must go far where his song cannot be heard.

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.700
The exile for life.

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:05.180
That's not fair.

01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:08.860
It is decided.

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:14.900
No.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:15.840
Pygon!

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.200
Brother!

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:19.360
Please!

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:19.820
No!

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.160
Pygon!

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:21.860
Brother!

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.000
This is...

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:30.660
This is wrong!

01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:31.880
This is wrong!

01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:34.820
You do not speak here.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:35.160
No!

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.780
Pygon fought for us!

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:37.900
He fought for us!

01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:38.140
Lord...

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:39.400
He saved your daughter's life!

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:40.760
He saved her life!

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:41.940
You do not speak here!

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:42.900
He defends us!

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:43.580
This is counsel!

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:44.500
No!

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.280
The elders have spoken!

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.500
The two Khun are being hunted!

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.020
They are dying!

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:49.640
Loak, that's enough.

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:50.360
No!

01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:52.140
Loak, speak the truth!

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:52.340
No!

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:53.300
No, sir!

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.620
Pygon is a warrior!

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.400
He fought for us!

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:57.180
More than you!

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:58.120
More than you!

01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.900
More than any of you!

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.060
He fought for us!

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:01.680
Sit down!

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.920
Take him from here!

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:04.740
Thank you, boy.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:05.220
Take a hold.

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:05.500
Dad!

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:06.580
Listen to him!

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:07.860
We are in counsel!

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:09.560
The elders have spoken.

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:10.940
What are you doing?

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.380
You never stand up for me!

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:15.280
Be seated.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:16.460
Come on.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.440
Counsel continues.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.320
We are at war.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.700
Do you understand that?

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.000
If you disobey orders, people get killed.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:28.100
Look.

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.580
We spy the here.

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:31.980
We're trying to keep a low profile.

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:33.500
But that rogue is out there.

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:34.700
He's stirring up the young wolves.

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:36.980
He was gonna bring a whole RDA down on us.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:38.940
You want him gone?

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:40.920
That's why you didn't say anything.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.200
He's a loose cannon.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.760
He's just like you.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.740
In fact, if you hadn't gone to him in the first place,

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:46.920
if you hadn't disobeyed orders,

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.200
and your brother would still be...

01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:56.420
That wasn't my fault!

01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:01.470
That's not my fault!

01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:06.510
Loak?

01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:25.130
Go to him, Jake.

01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:31.300
Or you will lose another son.

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.020
I've got nothing to say to him.

01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.140
Do not blame Loak.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.400
You said you could protect this family.

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:47.700
That you could do.

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.840
Yeah, I thought we would be safe here.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.260
Our son is dead, Jake!

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.200
I was wrong!

01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:58.820
What do you want me to say?

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.900
That every decision that I made for this family is wrong?

01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:03.560
I killed our son!

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.540
And still we are here in this place.

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.100
Hiding this pink skin.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.300
This alien.

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:20.660
If I had to choose between my family and a pink skin,

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:23.340
I would kill him right now.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.140
Stop, stop, stop.

01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:26.400
You're not doing this.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:27.680
You're not doing this.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:27.760
Yes!

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.780
You already chose between your family and a pink skin once.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:33.400
Remember?

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.500
You cannot live like this, baby.

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:42.200
In hate.

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:45.580
I hate them, Jake.

01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:47.160
I hate them.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.700
I hate them.

01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:51.760
I hate their pink little hands.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.860
I hate the insanity in their mind.

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:01.900
Inside?

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.540
You hate me?

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.280
I'll always be an alien to you, won't I?

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.960
Doesn't matter how long I live in their skin.

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:14.660
You hate your children.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.240
With their alien hands.

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:20.860
No.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.220
Are you ashamed?

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:26.720
Every time they make a mistake, every time they're different.

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:31.380
That's because of the human inside them, right?

01:15:56.210 --> 01:15:57.270
I'm sorry.

01:15:58.410 --> 01:15:59.470
I'm sorry.

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:04.260
We have to...

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.460
I'm staying strong right now.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.720
This family is our fortress.

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:35.500
The people say that when you touch steel,

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.520
it's poison seeps into your heart.

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:16.030
Stay in this life, brother.

01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:19.670
We need you.

01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:21.070
We love you.

01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:23.670
You have greatness in you.

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:42.610
The strength of the ancestors is here.

01:17:42.610 --> 01:17:43.470
We love you.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.160
The ball can be fixed.

01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:02.490
Go!

01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:06.630
Good.

01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:07.350
Good.

01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:17.910
Moment of truth.

01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:25.310
Go.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:31.040
Go.

01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:37.010
You feel her?

01:18:37.410 --> 01:18:38.030
Oh, yeah.

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:40.070
I got fins.

01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:42.530
Yeah, you do.

01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.870
Yeah, you do.

01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:43.890
Woo!

01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:46.450
Woo!

01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:47.870
You're a fucking guy!

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.080
I think we're worse not talking.

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:20.900
They don't know anything.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:21.840
Well, they know.

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:24.160
They're just not talking.

01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.300
We got one more play.

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.140
But it's radical.

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:14.140
Hey!

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:14.640
Hey!

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.660
You remember me, don't you?

01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:18.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:18.980
Mike!

01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:19.620
Just relax!

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:20.360
Get him up!

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:21.880
I brought something to inside here.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.900
You take me to inside here.

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:26.300
Hey, hey.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.380
No need to do that.

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:29.880
I got my eye on you.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.680
Keep going!

01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:55.680
Mike!

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.360
I'll get you as many as you want.

01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:29.070
What is your name, Skyman?

01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:30.490
Quarage.

01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:33.970
Colonel Miles Quarage.

01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:41.450
If you touch me with that thing again, I'll kill you.

01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:44.310
You will kill no one.

01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:49.050
Lady, I'm gonna beg to differ.

01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:50.450
Drop him.

01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:15.770
Good trick.

01:22:18.130 --> 01:22:18.850
Quarage.

01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:21.790
Your next cupcake.

01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:24.550
This isn't careful about what you want to do.

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:31.680
We will talk inside.

01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:40.130
What are you doing, boss?

01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:57.980
Cozy.

01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:02.390
The thing is...

01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:06.170
Everybody's lying to me.

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.080
They say that...

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:18.060
You can make Stone speak the truth.

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:19.680
You seek a man.

01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:22.240
The other Skyman like you.

01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.300
Not like me.

01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:26.700
No, he's a traitor.

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:29.800
Well, then he must die.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.580
But I can help you find this man.

01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:38.100
And the other you seek.

01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:43.560
This air breather.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:43.600
No.

01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:52.440
First, I must see your soul.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.420
Be still.

01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.460
Be still.

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:22.440
This is strong shit.

01:24:58.210 --> 01:24:59.590
This ...

01:25:00.730 --> 01:25:03.530
Is the only pure thing in this world.

01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:34.240
The fire came from the mountain when I was little. Burnt our forest. It took everything. My people were starving. They cried for help. But Ewa did not come.

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:45.500
So I went to the fire. And I learned its way.

01:25:50.710 --> 01:25:53.310
I am the fire.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:12.380
We do not lie down and die just because Ewa turns her back on us. We turn our back on Ewa.

01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:26.440
A weak mother. A weak children. We do not suck on the breast of weakness.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:49.510
Only true words will come from your tongue. You have a strong heart. No fear.

01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:57.870
That wasn't cool. I will eat your heart, Quaritch.

01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:12.690
At first, you will answer me. Why are you here?

01:27:12.690 --> 01:27:29.200
I am here for you. You wish to serve me? I don't serve anybody. I need you.

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:39.720
Well, I do not need you. I might keep you as my slave to pleasure me.

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:47.040
That sounds like a fun weekend, but that's not what you really want.

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:49.220
What do I want?

01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:52.720
What you've never had.

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.140
An equal.

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:03.420
You want to spread your fire across the world.

01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:03.580
I want to spread your fire across the world.

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:09.800
I'll give you guns. I'll give you comms.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:11.620
RPGs.

01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:14.000
But that's strong magic.

01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:16.860
Command from a distance.

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.820
Strike like lightning.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.560
The clans.

01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:23.120
The clans.

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.480
As far as you can fly.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.020
They'll bow down before Burra.

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.960
You want to take on Aor?

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:39.320
You need me.

01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:46.500
I see you.

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.920
Damn right you do.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:29:02.490
Damn right you do.

01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:10.950
When I can connect again.

01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:12.230
Someday.

01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:14.370
Whenever.

01:30:15.190 --> 01:30:17.850
I can be your guide in the spirit world.

01:30:19.130 --> 01:30:21.650
Well, can I just go now?

01:30:22.170 --> 01:30:22.830
No.

01:30:23.410 --> 01:30:24.450
Not without me.

01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:27.350
A sky person can't just show up.

01:30:28.450 --> 01:30:29.750
Freak out the ancestors.

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:41.900
They're starting to arrive.

01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:43.840
For the calf communion.

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:49.020
Yearling calves and reef babies.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:49.760
Together.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:52.060
Having the first bond with Hela.

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.900
It'll be so beautiful.

01:31:21.570 --> 01:31:22.310
What is it?

01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:25.770
It's good.

01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:27.730
I like this on you.

01:31:28.630 --> 01:31:29.970
Come to the festival.

01:31:30.190 --> 01:31:31.570
No, no, no, no.

01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:34.350
Then I will just stay here with you.

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:45.060
Look, I should not tell you this, but...

01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:49.880
My Tulkun sister says they have been hearing Payakan.

01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:51.340
Very faint.

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.040
Calling to his birth clan.

01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:53.520
Where?

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:53.540
Why?

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:55.520
Why?

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.820
Tulkun song travels very far through the water.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:58.280
The walk.

01:31:58.740 --> 01:31:59.000
Please.

01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:20.500
Hi.

01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:30.400
The walk.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:35.700
What, Mom?

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:38.440
Where are you going?

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:41.640
Just out.

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:45.560
There's something I have to do.

01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:22.740
We cannot go.

01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:24.920
The calf communion is in five days.

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:26.080
I have to go.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.520
This is my fault.

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:28.540
We are going.

01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:31.040
All of us.

01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:33.400
Get weapons and food.

01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:34.820
Tell no one.

01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:44.600
Our children have gone to look for him.

01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:46.280
He led them.

01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.300
They did not ask.

01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:50.880
I will get the ready to go out there.

01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:53.060
We cannot search the whole ocean.

01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:55.080
We need the warriors here for calf communion.

01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:56.520
If the demon ships come.

01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.960
My boy is out there by himself.

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:01.900
He will come back.

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:03.320
When he is dead.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:05.720
This is his pal.

01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:12.060
Look at what he did.

01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:17.840
Jake, the strength of the ancestors runs in your son's veins.

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:20.500
You must trust that.

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:28.160
The way of water.

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:29.520
There's no beginning.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.440
No end.

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:34.920
Seize your home.

01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:41.480
Before your birth.

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:49.640
And death to death.

01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:15.520
It's the one they call.

01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:19.040
How many fish are in the sea?

01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:19.900
One, two.

01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:21.740
How many birds are in the sky?

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:23.000
One, two, three.

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:25.320
I mean, come on.

01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:27.280
You couldn't have asked if it would make you a little bit taller.

01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:29.120
Maybe even a little bit more blue.

01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:29.900
No.

01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:30.000
No.

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:33.600
I was busy saving your life, Scal.

01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:35.060
Just a little bit.

01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:36.380
A couple of centimeters.

01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:39.820
She's the old mother.

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:40.940
She can do anything.

01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:44.920
You are perfect.

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.540
Just the way you are.

01:36:07.230 --> 01:36:08.370
Come on, monkey boy.

01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:14.190
So next thing is, I'm going to learn how to ride a skimwing.

01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:18.790
So you can become a mighty warrior and protect us all.

01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:20.890
Hey, it's not the size of the dog and the fight.

01:36:21.010 --> 01:36:22.170
It's the size of the fight and the dog.

01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:24.350
What is it?

01:36:30.730 --> 01:36:32.570
Come on!

01:36:33.090 --> 01:36:33.650
Run!

01:36:43.150 --> 01:36:44.070
Go!

01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.650
Go!

01:36:58.160 --> 01:36:59.200
Go on, dipshit!

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:01.300
Is that all you've got?

01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:04.100
Shit!

01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:09.120
Shut up out of there, cowboy!

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.080
Careful with that knife.

01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:12.320
That's how people get hurt.

01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:15.800
And breathe out.

01:37:31.170 --> 01:37:32.130
We fly!

01:37:32.650 --> 01:37:33.470
Break off.

01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:35.970
Dragonflight, new warning.

01:37:36.330 --> 01:37:37.170
You are clearing in.

01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:53.570
We'll stop.

01:37:53.690 --> 01:37:54.010
Doug!

01:38:02.050 --> 01:38:03.190
They're blocking us in.

01:38:03.290 --> 01:38:03.810
Weapons up.

01:38:04.130 --> 01:38:04.690
Weapons!

01:38:04.930 --> 01:38:05.710
Where's your sister?

01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.990
She went for water.

01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.890
Where's Kiri?

01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:08.510
Where's Spider?

01:38:11.450 --> 01:38:12.010
Dad!

01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:13.650
Where's Spider?

01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:14.510
They took him.

01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:16.230
The Blue Colonel took him.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:54.920
Go to him.

01:39:06.090 --> 01:39:06.570
Sully!

01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:09.590
Take the girls and you go, now!

01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:11.550
I will not go without you.

01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:14.270
Go! They got spiders. There's nothing holding them back.

01:39:14.370 --> 01:39:15.370
You've seen what they can do.

01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:18.010
These people will die.

01:39:18.370 --> 01:39:21.870
You cannot ask this. Husband, I cannot.

01:39:23.730 --> 01:39:24.850
This is the only way.

01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:29.070
Show yourself!

01:39:29.690 --> 01:39:31.850
You gotta go. You gotta go right now.

01:39:32.010 --> 01:39:34.030
Take your sister. Go and hide.

01:39:34.730 --> 01:39:35.270
Go!

01:39:37.450 --> 01:39:40.290
If you stay, I stay. I will kill Nani.

01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:42.770
Whatever happens, do not raise that ball.

01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:44.390
You swear to me.

01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:50.170
I know he's here. Give up to him.

01:39:50.890 --> 01:39:53.190
Here's my haina. Here's one of us.

01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:55.310
Here's one of us!

01:39:55.890 --> 01:39:57.150
Burn something.

01:39:57.650 --> 01:40:00.750
Dragon 2-4. Lay down some incendiary on the center village.

01:40:01.090 --> 01:40:02.510
Copy. Switching incendiary.

01:40:22.450 --> 01:40:25.070
Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Stop!

01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:27.190
Full fire!

01:40:28.630 --> 01:40:29.850
Copy. He's breaking off.

01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:33.650
This is my path, brother.

01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:51.400
Colonel.

01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:53.630
Colonel.

01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:54.090
Corporal.

01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:56.030
You take me?

01:40:56.230 --> 01:40:57.930
You leave my family and he's people alone.

01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:59.790
Not good enough.

01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:02.050
Gonna need the missions, too.

01:41:06.150 --> 01:41:07.390
You get me?

01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.470
We.

01:41:08.250 --> 01:41:11.030
Both of you are a hammer this place flat.

01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:13.830
Pregnant ladies, kids.

01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:17.270
I'll blow grandma's skinny shit through the back of the hooch,

01:41:17.330 --> 01:41:18.690
cause I just don't care.

01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:20.830
My pals here, well...

01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:23.970
They're just dying to waste everybody and take some scouts.

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:43.700
We're doing this?

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:48.180
When I drop my arm, you and your new girlfriend die.

01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:50.600
You in particular die a lot.

01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:52.780
I die, everybody here dies.

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:53.960
Maybe.

01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:57.200
I think you can get some of us, but not all of us.

01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:00.220
Maybe we bum-rush you, and your gunships hesitate,

01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:01.700
cause we all look the same.

01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:04.440
And then when you're begging for your life,

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:07.940
I'll scalp you.

01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:11.040
Well, damn, Corporal.

01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:14.500
I don't know if you're smart or just shit nuts.

01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:16.940
You never struck me as all that smart.

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:20.220
I need your word, marine to marine.

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:21.600
Safety.

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:23.700
For these people.

01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:26.360
Burn them all, courage.

01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:36.620
Do we have a deal?

01:42:43.930 --> 01:42:45.130
Wanna pick your swear?

01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:55.800
Take them!

01:43:25.810 --> 01:43:27.970
Another time then, Mrs. Sully.

01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:33.150
Saddle up!

01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:19.300
Man, we have a big incursion for Banshee riders inbound.

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:20.760
I see that, so line them up.

01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:22.500
I can't, ma'am. Weapons locked out.

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.260
They all have IFF badges.

01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:26.300
Expand it.

01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:26.380
No, that's okay.

01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:27.620
We can take a one-sixth spectrum target.

01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:28.660
They didn't encourage anyone?

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:06.140
You couldn't escape!

01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:22.680
Jake!

01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:24.700
Go next to a boat!

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:25.480
Jake!

01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:26.980
Jake!

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:31.260
Jake!

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:50.440
Messing accomplished, General.

01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:52.100
Jake's served.

01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:54.340
Tollerick, map Goodman theo himself.

01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:15.640
It's not enough for you to hand out guns. You've got to bring hostiles inside the perimeter.

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:25.560
My way. Not hostiles. Allies. General Ardmore, I'd like you to meet Baron Sahik of the Monquan.

01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:36.160
Let me make this very clear, Colonel Cochise. I want every one of these savages escorted off my base ASAP.

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:38.800
Including your little missy over here.

01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:49.920
Don't be a jackass, General. Take the win.

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:53.760
We got him, people!

01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:59.040
And not here!

01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:18.380
Is that you?

01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:19.380
No!

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:41.440
I love you, sir!

01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:51.870
No shell!

01:47:54.730 --> 01:47:55.670
I'm scared.

01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:58.950
I'm sorry.

01:48:03.330 --> 01:48:04.030
Michael!

01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:20.080
The people say, the sea washes you clean.

01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:26.130
It's Lot!

01:48:26.450 --> 01:48:27.070
It's him! Lot!

01:48:27.370 --> 01:48:28.210
It's him! Lot!

01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:29.630
Stop! Open here!

01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:29.930
Lot!

01:48:35.610 --> 01:48:40.250
They also say, if you see the Deep Ones, the Siam...

01:48:43.050 --> 01:48:44.950
...their spirits sent to judge you.

01:48:58.290 --> 01:48:58.610
Let's go!

01:48:58.610 --> 01:48:58.910
Stay up!

01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.590
Go, go, go!

01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:20.350
Stay up!

01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:30.910
Stay up!

01:49:39.150 --> 01:49:40.550
esp

01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:52.660
Oh my god.

01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:19.960
Look!

01:50:31.490 --> 01:50:32.810
Thank you, great mother.

01:50:34.210 --> 01:50:35.910
Come on, let him breathe. Let him go.

01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:42.180
Every of you guys came after me.

01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:45.000
My friend's path is my path.

01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:50.610
Is this your sister?

01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:51.270
Yes.

01:50:52.510 --> 01:50:54.730
What about Payakon? Does she hear him?

01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:56.850
He is close. He is coming now.

01:51:04.110 --> 01:51:05.010
So what have you got?

01:51:06.330 --> 01:51:08.970
This is mycelium that's living inside his body.

01:51:09.250 --> 01:51:10.650
Wait, is there something living inside of him?

01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:11.930
Yes, it's an indosymbium.

01:51:12.250 --> 01:51:13.930
Somehow moderating the ion exchange.

01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:16.010
Hey, stop. I don't need to know how it works.

01:51:16.190 --> 01:51:17.730
I just need to know if we can duplicate it.

01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:26.170
Let me out of here, you jerk-up!

01:51:29.850 --> 01:51:33.270
I told those rubber glove pukes to lay off you for a while.

01:51:33.810 --> 01:51:34.450
Where's Jake?

01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:37.690
He's locked up where he belongs.

01:51:38.090 --> 01:51:38.410
Here.

01:51:39.930 --> 01:51:41.210
I brought you a burger.

01:51:42.050 --> 01:51:43.030
Better not hurt him.

01:51:43.410 --> 01:51:44.890
He's not part of your life anymore.

01:51:46.210 --> 01:51:47.450
He's with me now.

01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:50.010
I'm your father.

01:51:50.490 --> 01:51:51.550
My father's dead.

01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:56.350
There's some made-up thing that he gave his memories to.

01:51:56.890 --> 01:51:57.890
No, no.

01:51:58.370 --> 01:51:59.490
I'm still me.

01:52:00.210 --> 01:52:01.130
I checked.

01:52:01.130 --> 01:52:02.070
Yeah, look.

01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:04.750
Colonel Myles Quartz.

01:52:06.330 --> 01:52:06.850
Deceased.

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:16.620
You know, we didn't get a chance to talk too much when we were out in the bush together, but...

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.160
I gotta thank you.

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:20.540
I mean...

01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:22.700
You hauled me out of a sunken ship.

01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:24.860
You saved my life.

01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:26.020
Yeah.

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:27.300
Sure wish I hadn't done that.

01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:30.660
Maybe that's true.

01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:31.520
Maybe...

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:33.640
Maybe deep down it isn't.

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.500
Either way...

01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:37.000
I owe you.

01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:39.140
And I gotta...

01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:40.660
Tell you that...

01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:43.300
Man, I'm proud of you.

01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:47.320
You're an amazing kid.

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:48.680
You got...

01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:49.520
Guts.

01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:52.060
Smarts and...

01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:53.580
Son, you got the heart of a lion.

01:52:55.380 --> 01:52:57.380
I see myself in you.

01:52:57.640 --> 01:52:58.300
Oh, yeah.

01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:02.300
I tell you how I really see in you.

01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:04.140
That's your mother.

01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:05.720
Oh, ho, ho.

01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:07.280
She was...

01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:08.780
Ferocious.

01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:11.300
Tough to live with.

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:14.300
I loved her.

01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:16.820
And man, did she love you.

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:23.020
Hardest thing she ever did was climbing aboard that gunship that day.

01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.200
Going into battle.

01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:26.880
Leaving her little baby behind.

01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:31.640
Your mom died a hero, son.

01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:35.160
You got that in you, too.

01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:41.400
Anyway, I didn't come down here and take a trip down memory lane.

01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:43.440
I just came by to tell you that I'm here for you.

01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:45.940
If...

01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:45.980
If...

01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:47.440
You need me...

01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:50.340
I'm here for you.

01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:55.100
Can I keep it?

01:54:05.610 --> 01:54:06.930
You need something, will you?

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.680
I see you, brother.

01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:34.660
What is it?

01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:35.540
What's wrong?

01:54:40.900 --> 01:54:42.560
Didn't you find your birth card?

01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:46.600
What?

01:54:48.740 --> 01:55:12.780
The Coon are already coming in.

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:16.720
But the aggregation doesn't peak until the eclipse.

01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:18.300
Which is the day after tomorrow.

01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:20.180
That's when we hit them.

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:22.120
No, no, hold on.

01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.700
No, you're talking about wholesale slaughter.

01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:25.140
Wow.

01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:28.080
Hundreds killed, entire parts just wiped out.

01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:29.540
That's the beauty of the idea.

01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:31.380
We'll fill a year's quota in just one day.

01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:33.960
These are intelligent, soulful beings.

01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:35.040
Who are you?

01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:37.360
Ian Garvin.

01:55:37.860 --> 01:55:39.000
The marine biologist.

01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:42.720
These creatures, they have culture.

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:43.760
They have music.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.180
They have names for each other.

01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:46.020
This is organized.

01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:48.340
This aggregation is deliberate.

01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:49.800
It's a spiritual gathering.

01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:52.080
Get off your high horse, Garvin.

01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:53.040
We all made our deals.

01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:55.120
No, I did not sign up for this.

01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:56.340
Dr. Garvin.

01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:57.520
Dr. Garvin, thank you.

01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:59.060
Your protest has been noted.

01:55:59.340 --> 01:55:59.960
It's been noted?

01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:00.240
Yes.

01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:05.740
Subteams and fastboats, you guys will form a cordon.

01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:11.040
You drive the family groups in here to where it forms a natural choke point against the islands.

01:56:22.090 --> 01:56:23.650
I have where you got him.

01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:29.240
Open up.

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:31.700
Open, sir.

01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:42.580
End of the line, Jake.

01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:45.800
Zero-six tomorrow.

01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:50.180
If you're wrong, what's your heart?

01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:52.460
I'm going old school.

01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:54.020
Firing squad.

01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:57.840
Selfridge says it's a better optic.

01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:01.020
Yeah, will you be a good dog for the suits?

01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:04.580
No.

01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:05.640
I can't get into it.

01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:05.760
No.

01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:07.300
No.

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:09.280
No.

01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:10.300
It's a good dog.

01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:10.820
No.

01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:10.960
No.

01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:13.600
I can't lose.

01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:34.480
Thank God, can't why?

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:40.780
There is a world out there. There's things that those suits will never understand.

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:46.500
The Navi call it Kameh. See.

01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:47.860
The ultimate world.

01:57:48.440 --> 01:58:03.980
And see this world. See yourself.

01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:12.220
I'll see you... at 06.

01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:11.720
But they were the ugliest ones in the village.

01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:34.920
Hands on the wall! Hands on the wall!

01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:55.260
It's nothing. Just one of the gorgeous guys.

02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:52.540
Okay. You've got a PhD. How hard can it be?

02:01:12.340 --> 02:01:13.660
Check this out.

02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:19.120
What's up, cutie?

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:19.660
Stop!

02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:27.080
Hey! Hey!

02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:27.880
Shh!

02:01:31.670 --> 02:01:32.350
Courage.

02:01:32.530 --> 02:01:33.070
Courage.

02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:38.120
We're the fire.

02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:39.100
Monk fire!

02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:39.500
Fire!

02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:40.120
Fire!

02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:46.900
Fire!

02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:47.760
Fire!

02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:48.820
Fire!

02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:49.420
Fire!

02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:50.200
Fire!

02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:54.520
Make no sound, witch.

02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:56.540
Where's Jake Soleil?

02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:57.960
The wife.

02:01:58.360 --> 02:01:59.880
Loyal to her man.

02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:01.360
Speak or I can't.

02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:06.100
Where?

02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:09.080
I will not ask again.

02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:10.700
Yeah.

02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:12.040
Okay.

02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:13.700
No, wait. Wait.

02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:15.920
That's the camp.

02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:18.760
A cage for an animal.

02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:20.020
Take me there.

02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:21.720
Move!

02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:22.480
Which way?

02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:22.960
Hey!

02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:23.460
Shoot me!

02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:29.080
We're on the party!

02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.890
Go, go, go!

02:02:59.970 --> 02:03:00.450
No!

02:03:36.370 --> 02:03:37.450
I have a situation.

02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:39.850
The kid is loose, and I need him back.

02:03:40.290 --> 02:03:40.770
Alive.

02:06:09.550 --> 02:06:11.670
Is my protest noted now, fuckers?

02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:13.310
Let's go.

02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:20.890
Jake.

02:06:22.010 --> 02:06:22.610
This way.

02:06:23.290 --> 02:06:24.230
No. No, this way.

02:06:24.290 --> 02:06:24.590
This way!

02:06:24.970 --> 02:06:25.410
Okay.

02:06:29.090 --> 02:06:29.870
Ian Garfin.

02:06:30.050 --> 02:06:30.630
Green Bio.

02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:32.390
Come on.

02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:35.530
Hey, I gotta say, I'm a real big fan of everything you've done.

02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:37.970
I'm working a little arms-mired right now.

02:06:38.090 --> 02:06:38.650
The way they...

02:06:38.650 --> 02:06:39.070
Shut up!

02:06:40.830 --> 02:06:41.570
What's the plan?

02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:44.410
This is as far as I got.

02:06:45.210 --> 02:06:46.350
But then there's no plan.

02:06:46.970 --> 02:06:47.810
Justin, it's here.

02:06:48.210 --> 02:06:48.850
Come on.

02:06:54.010 --> 02:06:54.910
Go, go, go!

02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:17.270
They're gonna hit them with every ship they've gone.

02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:21.410
Okay, I've given...

02:07:21.410 --> 02:07:22.450
They've gotta stop them.

02:07:22.810 --> 02:07:24.130
You're the only one who can.

02:07:25.750 --> 02:07:26.310
Come on.

02:07:41.410 --> 02:07:41.970
Let's go.

02:08:15.670 --> 02:08:16.910
Switch missiles, take them out.

02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.590
Copy.

02:08:17.810 --> 02:08:18.250
Switching missiles.

02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:37.300
Don't shoot.

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:38.240
Tell them not to shoot.

02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:40.360
Blue 1-6.

02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:40.920
Blue 1.

02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:41.780
Hold your fire.

02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:42.820
Keep fish holding on.

02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:44.300
1-6.

02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:44.840
Hold your fire.

02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:46.040
Get more assets in that position.

02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:47.400
Yeah, you're not gonna shoot me.

02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:47.940
You know why?

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:49.240
Because you cans!

02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:49.980
Ha!

02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:51.240
You know you can, you though?

02:08:51.500 --> 02:08:52.840
You can kiss my ass!

02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:53.600
Yeah!

02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:55.100
Come on, Jake, go!

02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:55.940
What are you doing?

02:08:56.060 --> 02:08:56.340
Come on!

02:08:56.500 --> 02:08:56.740
Go!

02:08:57.100 --> 02:08:57.260
Go!

02:08:57.480 --> 02:08:57.960
Come on!

02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:00.460
He's moving west.

02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:12.460
Stay close to me!

02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:14.240
I'm not gonna play this game.

02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:15.200
Lean 1-6.

02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:15.920
Take your shot.

02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:16.340
No!

02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:16.820
No!

02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:17.580
Don't shoot!

02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:18.980
Do your way back.

02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:19.840
Hold on fire.

02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:20.920
Go, go, go!

02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:22.480
Lean 1-6!

02:09:22.660 --> 02:09:23.520
Lean 1-6.

02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:25.920
Lean 1-6.

02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:26.600
I'm coming around.

02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:29.760
He's coming back around!

02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:30.160
This way.

02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:32.120
This is Blue 1.

02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:32.940
Check your fire.

02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:34.080
Lean 1-6.

02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:34.940
You want some air hot.

02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:36.660
1-6 in hot.

02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:42.700
1-6 in hot.

02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:43.700
Go!

02:09:52.990 --> 02:09:54.030
I shake!

02:09:55.230 --> 02:09:55.990
Let's hear you.

02:09:57.410 --> 02:09:57.970
Baby!

02:09:58.270 --> 02:10:01.470
I don't know whether they kiss you or get out of your...

02:10:01.470 --> 02:10:02.330
It's your last time!

02:10:02.930 --> 02:10:03.950
Come on, let's go!

02:10:06.610 --> 02:10:07.310
Let's go!

02:10:22.980 --> 02:10:24.100
Land anywhere.

02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:48.270
Gotta take a huge leap.

02:10:49.210 --> 02:10:50.830
You guys landed just in time.

02:10:52.130 --> 02:10:53.070
What is it?

02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:54.810
Why are we stopping?

02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:02.010
They didn't even put a fly in this thing.

02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:03.510
That's just dumb.

02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:05.390
Good idea.

02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:07.510
Drink first, then piss in the stream.

02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:08.650
What is it, Jake?

02:11:10.190 --> 02:11:11.050
I was wrong.

02:11:12.210 --> 02:11:13.630
We can't protect him.

02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:16.690
Gotta take this stuff off.

02:11:17.070 --> 02:11:17.690
It's itchy as hell.

02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:19.510
You're gorgeous.

02:11:19.730 --> 02:11:21.550
There's a woman you can find us wherever we go.

02:11:25.370 --> 02:11:26.990
They will study him.

02:11:27.650 --> 02:11:29.750
And when humans can breathe our air.

02:11:31.450 --> 02:11:34.530
Then they will spread across this world.

02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:38.710
And they will destroy the forests, the oceans, everything just like on Earth.

02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:42.390
Then the Navi people will be gone.

02:11:46.050 --> 02:11:49.330
And I can't let that happen.

02:11:49.330 --> 02:11:50.650
Are you hungry?

02:11:50.830 --> 02:11:51.430
I'm starving.

02:11:58.480 --> 02:11:59.140
You were right.

02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:05.960
It has to be done.

02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:08.820
Jake.

02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:12.940
He saved your life.

02:12:25.050 --> 02:12:26.550
It's just the only way.

02:12:39.530 --> 02:12:40.170
Spider.

02:12:42.570 --> 02:12:43.350
Come here.

02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:52.020
What's going on?

02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:56.300
What is it?

02:12:57.400 --> 02:12:58.520
She's coming to me.

02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:02.580
Come on, let's go.

02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:14.360
They stopped for a second and they gotta take a leak.

02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:15.780
Just stay close.

02:13:25.170 --> 02:13:25.910
Where are we going?

02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.770
Be quiet.

02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:45.920
Is this like a talk?

02:13:59.200 --> 02:13:59.760
Come here.

02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:06.220
This will work.

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:08.740
Kneel.

02:14:10.180 --> 02:14:10.580
Kneel.

02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:11.560
No.

02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:11.900
No.

02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:14.240
Please.

02:14:15.820 --> 02:14:17.020
Jake, please stop.

02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:18.760
Ice front.

02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:20.080
Don't move.

02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:21.080
Please.

02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:23.120
You don't have to do this.

02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:25.980
Please.

02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:28.880
Grandmother, are you here?

02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:32.460
You don't have to do this.

02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:34.620
Guide my hand.

02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:35.700
Please don't do this.

02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:36.740
Give me strength.

02:14:37.180 --> 02:14:37.560
Just stop.

02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:39.480
Please stop.

02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:40.260
Please.

02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:42.260
Don't look at me.

02:14:42.260 --> 02:14:42.380
Please.

02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:43.980
Don't look at me.

02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:47.740
Forgive me, son.

02:14:48.540 --> 02:14:49.460
I'll be good.

02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:51.040
May your spirit go to anyone.

02:14:51.460 --> 02:14:52.000
I promise.

02:14:52.180 --> 02:14:53.820
May your body return to the forest.

02:14:56.180 --> 02:14:58.100
To preserve the green balance.

02:14:59.420 --> 02:15:01.060
And the ancestors welcome you.

02:15:16.420 --> 02:15:17.000
Please.

02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:19.060
Please.

02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:20.520
May the ancestors hold you.

02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:22.500
May they sing your song.

02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:25.860
I know I have to go to anyone now.

02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:28.520
It's okay.

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:29.520
But...

02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:31.680
But...

02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:33.720
Do you...

02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:34.680
Do you...

02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:35.220
Do you still love me?

02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:38.600
With all my heart.

02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:35.740
I see you.

02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:35.860
I see you.

02:16:43.810 --> 02:16:46.130
Whatever happens, it won't be. This way.

02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:50.190
Then we will find another way.

02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:11.520
My dad knew in his heart there was only ever one path.

02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:27.300
No matter how you imagine yourself, as a father, as a husband, sooner or later, you're back on it.

02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:52.340
Turuk loved my father.

02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:56.940
He knew they were greater together.

02:17:57.820 --> 02:18:00.780
That when they flew, there would be blood.

02:18:04.470 --> 02:18:05.690
He is coming.

02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:39.320
No, no, no. Just, please, stand. Stand up. Please.

02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:41.540
Baby. Jake.

02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:44.860
Please. It's okay. It's okay.

02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:51.240
Go now, to all the clans within a day's ride, and tell them.

02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:54.980
Tell them.

02:18:58.700 --> 02:18:59.760
And you tell them.

02:19:01.620 --> 02:19:02.720
The day has come.

02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:07.560
No!

02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:08.740
No!

02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:51.800
And so it came to pass, that Turuk Mato returned. My father united the clans once again. He made the great speeches.

02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:55.420
Any arrows together. He cannot be broken.

02:19:57.770 --> 02:19:59.430
He cannot be broken!

02:20:06.990 --> 02:20:09.650
But he knew that it wasn't enough.

02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:28.480
Great matriarch.

02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:30.160
Wise elders.

02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:33.580
The sky people are coming.

02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:35.360
Here. Today.

02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:36.700
Right now.

02:20:37.340 --> 02:20:39.200
To kill our two Khun families.

02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:41.300
I beg you.

02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:43.400
Fight with us.

02:20:51.390 --> 02:20:54.650
She says, we respect Turuk Mato.

02:20:55.170 --> 02:20:56.850
But our ways are ancient.

02:21:00.970 --> 02:21:04.810
We believe that killing will only bring more killing.

02:21:05.620 --> 02:21:08.110
In an endless, expanding spiral.

02:21:10.410 --> 02:21:11.890
Hear my words.

02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:16.230
The sky people will never stop.

02:21:16.830 --> 02:21:19.150
Not until the last of the Tokun is hunted.

02:21:19.850 --> 02:21:20.490
hit.

02:21:36.490 --> 02:21:42.810
Look what are you doing?

02:21:43.130 --> 02:21:44.130
Which can't be here.

02:21:46.350 --> 02:21:47.310
Hey買ner, preciso.

02:21:47.690 --> 02:21:49.070
I have a right to speak.

02:21:49.530 --> 02:21:50.870
Vlog speaks the truth.

02:21:51.250 --> 02:21:51.730
You must.

02:21:52.730 --> 02:22:00.610
She says his brother is outcast.

02:22:01.490 --> 02:22:04.070
You have no standing here.

02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:10.210
If he is outcast, then I am outcast.

02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:13.450
And I am outcast.

02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:18.370
Doctor, silence. No! You will never see me again.

02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:23.350
And I and my brother are outcast.

02:22:23.710 --> 02:22:28.110
Oh no! And we are also outcast.

02:22:40.370 --> 02:22:43.670
She says, you may speak.

02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:49.260
Hear my words.

02:22:49.700 --> 02:22:53.060
My brother returned to his birth clan to defend him.

02:22:53.420 --> 02:22:56.980
But his clan was wiped out by the demon ships.

02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:01.480
Only Tatnok survived, because she fought back.

02:23:02.860 --> 02:23:03.920
Come forward.

02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:39.360
I speak for the dead mothers and the dead calves.

02:23:44.660 --> 02:23:47.940
I speak for my people and all our songs.

02:23:53.450 --> 02:23:54.110
Forever.

02:23:59.870 --> 02:24:04.330
She says, I am the last. The blind witness to our end.

02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:13.710
The unknown says. It's what Corn go home must change.

02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:16.110
Payack an't choice our path.

02:24:26.470 --> 02:24:27.830
We must fight!

02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:47.280
What is she saying?

02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:49.380
They will decide.

02:24:51.300 --> 02:25:09.520
Look at all of this. I mean, there's hundreds of them. And look at all these old ones, and old is good. They never stop growing. Which means more around Rita. And look at this mother. She must be a hundred meters.

02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:14.880
You're briefing without me. An oversight, I assume?

02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:23.000
No, it's not an oversight. After your fiasco with Sully, you're done, Colonel. You're confined to base pending an investigation.

02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:28.900
Negative on that. I need to roll. Sully will be there, which means that Spider will be there as well.

02:25:28.980 --> 02:25:31.340
Don't look at him. He's one step away from the brig himself.

02:25:31.540 --> 02:25:34.400
Don't tell him not to look at me. What are you gonna do? Call daddy?

02:25:34.820 --> 02:25:35.860
You mean the chairman?

02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:36.500
It's enough.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.660
I can still complete this mission.

02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:46.540
Look at you. You're a disgrace to your uniform. Assuming you remember what a uniform is.

02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:50.500
You're grounded, Colonel. Permanently.

02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:07.940
Why are you here, girl?

02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:11.600
To pray, Zaheek.

02:26:16.310 --> 02:26:17.210
No, child.

02:26:21.100 --> 02:26:22.980
Why did you come to us?

02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:29.020
Perhaps it was for this moment.

02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:35.560
Only a chosen one may call upon the warrior mother.

02:26:38.580 --> 02:26:40.900
Oh, Zaheek.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:43.360
You're having contraptions.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:47.480
I fear we will... we will not survive this.

02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.950
Kitty.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:57.540
Hear my words.

02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:04.960
If there is something you can do, then you must do it.

02:27:08.530 --> 02:27:10.830
You have a strong heart.

02:27:13.980 --> 02:27:14.900
I'm ready, you two.

02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:16.640
No, I need you here.

02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:20.220
I can't do this.

02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:21.600
Unless I know your kids are safe.

02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:23.660
You keep your post no matter what happens.

02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:24.860
You read me?

02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:26.640
Let me try this out.

02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:36.620
If your father and I do not return, you take Spider.

02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:40.840
And the girls, and you go as far and as fast as you can.

02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:27.780
Holy shit.

02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:34.520
Flux is off the scale.

02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:39.380
If you put a wide radius from that flux devil, that thing will rip your face off.

02:28:39.820 --> 02:28:41.260
Roger, gun rotor coming right.

02:28:49.380 --> 02:29:00.440
Okay, boys, let's make some bang!

02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:01.100
Yeah!

02:29:02.020 --> 02:29:03.920
Let's go, let's do this!

02:29:39.630 --> 02:29:41.030
See any hostiles?

02:29:41.770 --> 02:29:43.090
Negative, no movement.

02:29:43.090 --> 02:29:45.590
And the big guys are just doing their thing.

02:29:48.740 --> 02:29:50.230
Fish in a barrel, Scoresby.

02:29:51.370 --> 02:29:51.990
Holes!

02:29:55.610 --> 02:29:56.830
There's holes.

02:29:58.130 --> 02:29:58.910
Holes.

02:30:00.830 --> 02:30:01.610
Holes.

02:30:13.970 --> 02:30:15.770
There's no bulls.

02:30:15.770 --> 02:30:17.730
And no big females.

02:30:17.730 --> 02:30:17.850
And no big females.

02:30:18.990 --> 02:30:20.150
There's no elders.

02:30:22.610 --> 02:30:24.370
Hold up, everybody.

02:30:25.410 --> 02:30:27.130
Sir, I got a big signature.

02:30:28.010 --> 02:30:28.490
Tulcun.

02:30:28.830 --> 02:30:29.650
Big ones.

02:30:30.350 --> 02:30:31.610
Lots of big ones.

02:30:31.930 --> 02:30:33.310
Loadable tulcun inbound.

02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:47.480
Scoresby.

02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:48.960
I thought you told me you're not aggressive.

02:30:49.880 --> 02:30:50.680
Well, they're not.

02:30:52.340 --> 02:30:52.700
General.

02:34:57.250 --> 02:34:59.110
That's getting sunny on the open, General.

02:34:59.390 --> 02:35:00.250
I'm taking food.

02:35:45.400 --> 02:35:45.860
Stop her!

02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:46.020
Hey!

02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:47.460
Hey, stop!

02:35:48.340 --> 02:35:49.260
Get him, stop, stop, stop.

02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:50.760
Get back to the shelter right now.

02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:51.500
It's not safe out here.

02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:53.220
I have to call to the Great Mother.

02:35:53.340 --> 02:35:54.820
If you connect underwater, it'll kill you.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:55.920
You can't do this!

02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:56.680
We have to go!

02:35:57.120 --> 02:35:57.980
We can get me out here, I know.

02:36:11.740 --> 02:36:12.640
Tulcun, you stay back!

02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:13.260
I mean it!

02:36:13.900 --> 02:36:14.680
Come on!

02:36:48.300 --> 02:36:49.040
You can fight with us!

02:36:52.500 --> 02:36:52.900
Go!

02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:53.900
I'll stay with her!

02:36:54.700 --> 02:36:55.300
Come on!

02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:14.300
Please help us!

02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:16.860
I save you!

02:37:17.940 --> 02:37:19.600
You are our only hope!

02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:33.460
Please!

02:37:33.900 --> 02:37:35.320
We need you!

02:37:54.530 --> 02:37:55.510
No!

02:37:55.870 --> 02:37:56.250
No!

02:37:56.810 --> 02:37:57.070
No!

02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:42.910
Please, no!

02:38:45.330 --> 02:38:46.350
Tulc!

02:38:46.630 --> 02:38:47.090
Lana!

02:41:00.980 --> 02:41:02.340
That's him. Get him.

02:41:08.150 --> 02:41:09.510
Frank out. Rock some in.

02:41:40.480 --> 02:41:41.340
Good girl.

02:41:58.470 --> 02:41:59.210
Are you okay?

02:41:59.650 --> 02:42:00.170
Yes.

02:42:01.530 --> 02:42:02.230
Where's Jerry?

02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.330
Wait.

02:42:08.060 --> 02:42:09.140
She ain't coming down.

02:42:10.660 --> 02:42:11.660
Get to safety.

02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:13.200
Do not attack.

02:42:15.980 --> 02:42:16.740
We're done.

02:42:40.260 --> 02:42:41.760
Okay. It's okay. I got you.

02:42:49.470 --> 02:42:49.990
Sahih!

02:42:52.050 --> 02:43:04.720
Stay here. I'm going back for her.

02:43:04.980 --> 02:43:06.280
I can't even find myself.

02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:06.300
No!

02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:16.960
Satan, wait.

02:43:18.380 --> 02:43:27.660
Why must you always argue?

02:43:28.340 --> 02:43:30.740
I am... I am dying.

02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:33.340
But first I will push out this baby.

02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:36.780
Get down!

02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:43.280
Don't push!

02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:47.080
I got you, I got you.

02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:54.070
I'm going to pull it after you.

02:43:54.170 --> 02:43:54.770
No, don't, don't.

02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:56.550
Just don't.

02:43:56.550 --> 02:43:57.810
I got to pack the wounds.

02:43:58.350 --> 02:44:10.960
I got to pack the wounds.

02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:11.820
Kitty!

02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:13.140
Kitty!

02:44:13.580 --> 02:44:14.420
Kitty!

02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:23.920
Are you okay?

02:44:26.180 --> 02:44:27.100
Good.

02:44:28.600 --> 02:44:30.080
Who are you.

02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:33.720
Hello?

02:44:36.460 --> 02:44:36.580
My push.

02:44:38.140 --> 02:44:39.580
She's coming.

02:44:40.380 --> 02:44:41.500
She's coming.

02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:44.740
No, no.

02:44:45.820 --> 02:44:46.640
Disturbed.

02:44:52.460 --> 02:44:54.060
Thank you.

02:45:02.670 --> 02:45:25.770
What is her name? She is Pril. Miss Rome. Pril is a good name. You will protect her? Yes.

02:45:49.540 --> 02:45:53.200
Dad, I'm sorry I left my post. It's okay.

02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:59.460
Hey, son. You've proven yourself to me. I mean...

02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:08.360
I'm proud of you.

02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:46.040
Alright, people. Let's get ourselves together. We've still got work to do.

02:46:49.720 --> 02:46:54.760
Seriously? There's a hundred billion dollars waiting in that cove and nothing standard in our way.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:58.220
Beers are on me.

02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:07.080
Your name is Pril. Your mother was powerful. You will be powerful too.

02:47:07.300 --> 02:47:08.140
Mrs. Sully!

02:47:15.370 --> 02:47:17.210
Oh boy!

02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:29.020
Spoils of war.

02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:50.500
Ted! Ted, look! I need you now. By my side. I need my wingman!

02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:53.280
Okay, let's move out.

02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:08.940
Drake, I know you're out there.

02:48:09.260 --> 02:48:10.440
I know you didn't get in.

02:48:11.480 --> 02:48:14.220
What you're wrong here is lighting up your wife pretty good.

02:48:23.310 --> 02:48:27.270
Now I want you to come in and I want you to bring Spider with you.

02:48:27.270 --> 02:48:29.530
And I know you copy that.

02:48:30.550 --> 02:48:31.590
Thanks, baby.

02:48:37.420 --> 02:48:39.940
Pick a horse! Get in there! Go, go!

02:48:55.140 --> 02:48:56.140
What's happening?

02:48:56.660 --> 02:48:58.820
Let's get those heifers herded in tight.

02:49:27.060 --> 02:49:28.020
We've been spacing.

02:49:29.900 --> 02:49:32.380
Some teams. Torpedoes ready.

02:49:33.540 --> 02:49:33.940
Torpedoes.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.020
Fermi motion 4. Torpedoes armed.

02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:37.020
60 meters.

02:49:38.140 --> 02:49:38.720
Torpedo mark.

02:49:50.750 --> 02:49:52.030
Stand by to fire.

02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:22.840
All fire for what?

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:24.640
We've got a situation down here.

02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:26.560
They tell you why it worked.

02:50:27.460 --> 02:50:28.500
It worked!

02:50:50.610 --> 02:50:51.270
Look up!

02:50:52.330 --> 02:50:53.410
Get us out of here!

02:51:15.470 --> 02:51:16.930
Go, go, go! Hit it!

02:51:17.670 --> 02:51:20.490
All boats back to the ship! All boats back to the ship!

02:52:24.880 --> 02:52:26.040
Get us out of here!

02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:26.780
Get up!

02:52:26.880 --> 02:52:27.720
Propulsion's down!

02:53:33.490 --> 02:53:35.070
Flux devil's pulling us in!

02:53:37.650 --> 02:53:38.630
Abandon ship!

02:53:40.030 --> 02:53:41.050
Abandon ship!

02:53:47.420 --> 02:53:48.480
Stay close.

02:54:05.460 --> 02:54:06.140
Clear!

02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:14.760
You're alive!

02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:15.760
Get off of here!

02:54:22.790 --> 02:54:23.970
I'll need a cupboard of fire.

02:54:25.310 --> 02:54:25.430
Okay.

02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:29.550
I'm gonna push left, down the port side, and get around behind them.

02:54:29.770 --> 02:54:30.950
Get eyes on me. Just watch me.

02:54:31.430 --> 02:54:31.850
Yes, sir.

02:54:32.470 --> 02:54:33.470
Don't shoot anyone you love.

02:54:34.810 --> 02:54:35.530
Go, go!

02:54:48.780 --> 02:54:49.420
Colonel.

02:54:49.900 --> 02:54:50.760
It's a spider.

02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:51.740
I'm here.

02:54:52.140 --> 02:54:53.160
Don't kill them.

02:54:56.520 --> 02:54:57.700
Where are you, boy?

02:54:58.100 --> 02:54:59.120
Step out now.

02:55:01.320 --> 02:55:01.960
Alright.

02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:03.220
I'll come out.

02:55:16.330 --> 02:55:16.970
Spider!

02:55:17.730 --> 02:55:18.730
You hear me?

02:55:19.050 --> 02:55:20.370
We're running out of time.

02:55:35.580 --> 02:55:36.100
Right?

02:55:46.210 --> 02:55:47.370
I'm here to make a deal.

02:55:48.590 --> 02:55:49.430
Me for them.

02:55:50.530 --> 02:55:51.350
That can happen.

02:55:52.810 --> 02:55:54.010
Come with me, son.

02:55:54.550 --> 02:55:56.150
I'm a man of my word.

02:55:56.470 --> 02:55:58.470
We can resolve this here and now.

02:55:58.610 --> 02:55:59.730
Everybody goes home.

02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:11.200
Circle up!

02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:12.080
We're out of here!

02:56:59.460 --> 02:57:02.120
Leave my mother alone.

02:57:09.100 --> 02:57:10.100
Bitch!

02:57:32.180 --> 02:57:59.990
Hang on, kid.

02:59:44.320 --> 02:59:45.520
I'll kill you!

02:59:45.700 --> 02:59:46.360
I swear!

02:59:47.440 --> 02:59:49.480
You're gonna kill your own father?

02:59:50.440 --> 02:59:52.640
Do not test me!

02:59:55.220 --> 02:59:56.360
Give me that.

02:59:59.700 --> 03:00:01.440
You little bastard!

03:00:07.100 --> 03:00:08.080
Get out of here!

03:00:08.460 --> 03:00:08.780
Go on!

03:01:51.420 --> 03:01:52.020
Shut up!

03:02:10.280 --> 03:02:12.280
If you haven't just shot me in the arm!

03:02:15.620 --> 03:02:17.040
I'll let you go.

03:02:17.780 --> 03:02:18.540
Then do it!

03:02:19.360 --> 03:02:19.940
Dad!

03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:22.780
You need some piece of work, kid.

03:02:24.060 --> 03:02:24.980
Pull that stuff!

03:02:56.160 --> 03:02:57.560
Jake!

03:03:19.460 --> 03:03:21.780
Oh, this is awkward.

03:03:28.390 --> 03:03:30.130
Now what?

03:03:30.130 --> 03:04:06.330
We're all gonna hold hands and sing. Or learn to see. You have a choice. Ain't this a bitch?

03:04:54.570 --> 03:05:11.170
The light always returns. We all connect with the great mother.

03:05:14.250 --> 03:05:16.750
Who holds all her children in her heart.

03:05:21.300 --> 03:05:28.240
New life keeps the energy flowing. Like the breath of the world.

03:05:31.650 --> 03:05:37.790
My brother's voice was heard. He was accepted by the clan.

03:05:52.280 --> 03:06:02.400
In the spirit world, we call upon the strength of the ancestors. All those who have walked the path before us.

03:06:14.780 --> 03:06:17.140
Come on, monkey boy, come on!

03:06:40.080 --> 03:06:41.940
Sir... I see you.

03:06:42.360 --> 03:06:43.000
I see you.

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:44.300
Bro!

03:06:45.900 --> 03:06:47.340
The scout.

03:06:48.660 --> 03:06:50.660
I'm happy to see you, little bro.

03:06:52.800 --> 03:06:53.280
Cuz...

03:06:53.760 --> 03:06:58.420
Mom, this is spider. I've heard all about you.

03:06:59.980 --> 03:07:00.520
Troublemaker.

03:07:01.060 --> 03:07:01.100
Troublemaker.

03:07:04.040 --> 03:07:07.440
You are alive for the first time.

03:07:07.980 --> 03:07:11.560
And your spirit will live in anyone.

03:07:12.720 --> 03:07:13.060
Forever.

03:07:14.960 --> 03:07:15.340
You...

03:07:16.240 --> 03:07:17.000
You...

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:18.000
Are one of us now.

03:07:18.460 --> 03:07:19.280
You are...

03:07:19.780 --> 03:07:20.880
One of the people.

03:07:22.260 --> 03:07:22.940
Oh shit!

03:07:22.940 --> 03:07:23.240
's...

03:08:07.920 --> 03:08:09.000
This is...

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.380
Our love will never find...

03:08:12.840 --> 03:08:16.040
Diamonds in the dark...

03:08:16.040 --> 03:08:19.660
I put my head against your chest...

03:08:19.660 --> 03:08:21.760
And listen to your...

03:08:21.760 --> 03:08:50.980
Cause you are my hope. No matter where I go. Never alone. So now I always know. Even through the flames. Even through the ashes in the sky. Baby when we dream, we dream as mine.

03:08:52.320 --> 03:09:27.660
Every time I pray. It's a song to give this love. So beautiful. We're together. Like feathers run away. Right, right beside me. We're two arrows in the wind. Cause you are my hope. No matter where I go.

03:09:27.660 --> 03:10:05.320
In the sky. Baby when we dream, we dream. It's a song to give this love. I know when we dream, we dream as one. Dream.

03:10:21.160 --> 03:10:28.000
Even through the ashes in the sky, baby, when we dream, we dream.

03:10:29.305 --> 03:11:29.504
